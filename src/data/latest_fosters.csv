They are about 6 months old and were rescued off the streets. They’ve come so far since they were rescued and show every day how much they love being indoor kitties.

Bella is a purr machine and adored attention. She can’t get enough morning pets, night time snuggles and really any opportunity to hang. Clara’s love language is quieter, but once you swaddle her in a blanket or towel, know she’s in her happy place. She lives for some behind the ear scratches. Together they are quite a special pair.Bella and Clara let us clip their nails with no problems and aren’t into scratching surfaces other than their scratch pads.

castle,Castle,8 year-old tabby lady,Needs a home ASAP,"From her fosterer: Castle is the sweetest friend to have around the house.

They are adorable and as they are from the same yard we think they'd like to stay together for good. From their caretaker:<br/><br/>Widdie is the best! She was rescued from a backyard in Brooklyn and her former temporary<br/>bed was lined with newspapers, the front page of which had an article about Spencer Dinwiddie<br/>from the Brooklyn Nets in all caps. She happened to be sitting on the ‘din’ when it was decided<br/>we needed to name her. Widdie has stuck ever since. She loves people, is very trusting, and<br/>more wonover by attention than food. Her appetite from curiosity is also very present in her<br/>personality, a character who wants to know and learn. She loves to cuddle and be pet in your<br/>lap. She loves to hunt a feather toy, or any toy for that matter. Her favorite spaces are in or<br/>near windows and don’t forget to acknowledge her everytime you see her - its her favorite thing!<br/><br/>Beau loves to be around people and will be all in with a lounge or a chill session. He is also food obsessed, you can really excite him with treats or a can of food! We think this is why he has a scruffy nose because when he was found outdoors he was always too hungry to realize he would push his whole face in the bowl! His favorite toy is a dancing string but he’s known to play-attack his own tail and roll around happily.  If he’s not entertaining himself, he’s usually lounging about waiting for the next mealtime.  He’s a very gentle and calm young man!<br/><br/>***please pick (intake) option when scheduling pick up!<br/></span></span></p></div><div aria-disabled=""false"" class=""comp-kjevao5b3 R6ex7N"" id=""comp-kjevao5b3__89c7ab75-eb6e-4182-8389-20d0eb2efd47""><a aria-disabled=""false"" class=""kuTaGy wixui-button zKbzSQ"" data-testid=""linkElement"" href=""https://bbawcfosterteam.wixsite.com/cats/avaliblecats/widdle-%26-bo"" target=""_self""><span class=""M3I7Z2 wixui-button__label"">Learn More &gt;&gt;</span></a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>",2023-03-29 14:25:03+00:00
