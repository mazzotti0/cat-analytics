She might be a little slow to warm up to you at first, but once you have won her loyalty, this tabby won’t be afraid to follow you around, nudge, and nuzzle you.

She goes absolutely crazy for chicken treats and will climb onto your lap for one.

jemma,Jemma,Adult tuxedo lady,Ready ,"Little is known about Jemma's history, but she is a friendly cat that somehow ended up living in a colony outside of a Home Depot in Brooklyn.

moby-dick,Moby Dick (reserved),7 year-old all black male,"Ready starting 3/20, at the cafe","Witness my [black, scraggly, ever-hungry] white whale! This is Moby Dick putting on his best mopey face in an attempt to score second (or possibly third) breakfast. I had been spotting this friend for nearly a year running across the busy streets in my neighborhood but had never been successful finding his main hang-out spots or tempting him with food.

tully,Tully (reserved),3ish year-old tabby male,"Ready now, rescuer can meet you at the cafe","From his rescuer: Tully arrived in my yard in early Summer 2021.  He was full of scrappy young cat vibes, bold, and ready for a fight…and then he had one (with a raccoon!) and ended up with a bad leg bite! Luckily I had a neuter appt for him and we treated the leg, put him in a kennel to recover and he trashed the place like a proper rock star.  When he returned to my yard, he scared away all the females in the colony and had various escapades such as bringing me baby possums as gifts, getting stuck in a tree, and thinking of my raised bed as a giant litter box (who can blame him).  However, over the year and a half he’s been with me he’s softened. He’d weave in and out of my legs but was not pettable. He’d still give me the occasional hiss, wasn’t touchable (except a little while eating), and swatted when feeling threatened. He is food motivated and endlessly curious so we got him a treat ball to keep him busy while we gardened. He liked to think of my yard as his and he basically never left. He’d come to my window nightly and meow for attention (and to visit one of my cats).  Fast forward to one morning in December 2022 - I whistled to call Tully to breakfast and he came with a chattering drooling jaw and kept pawing at his mouth. We thought he’d been poisoned! I got him in a carrier and to the ER and they discovered he’d broken a tooth off to the gum line and has pretty bad dental disease. Poor guy was in terrible pain and likely had been for some time (I’d be cranky too with a mouth like that). Fortunately, through a series of amazing, helpful, and passionate rescue friends, I brought him inside and his dental work will be done soon. While he’s been in his kennel he’s changed a lot.  His energy, while still sometimes guarded, has become more friendly - he’s purring, kneading, and eating off of people’s fingers and I even taught him to sit! He deserves a chance to become a house cat. He can still get startled and swat, but he is a totally different cat.    He is absolutely unable to have another cat in the house - he gets very stressed. The holding space with cats in and out has been challenging for him. ** Select Foster Pick Up (Intake) when scheduling****","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/7f467d_a389bffa67804090a4b8726e9ac048d6~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_551,h_440,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/Image-empty-state.jpg",https://bbawcfosterteam.wixsite.com/cats/avaliblecats/tully-(reserved),"<div class=""comp-kjevao4x5 YzqVVZ wixui-repeater__item"" id=""comp-kjevao4x5__29be10c7-1c28-4c5f-974c-d96805837f88""><div class=""MW5IWV"" data-hook=""bgLayers"" id=""bgLayers_comp-kjevao4x5""><div class=""LWbAav Kv1aVt"" data-testid=""colorUnderlay""></div><div class=""VgO9Yg"" id=""bgMedia_comp-kjevao4x5""></div></div><div class="""" data-mesh-id=""comp-kjevao4x5__29be10c7-1c28-4c5f-974c-d96805837f88inlineContent"" data-testid=""inline-content""><div data-mesh-id=""comp-kjevao4x5__29be10c7-1c28-4c5f-974c-d96805837f88inlineContent-gridContainer"" data-testid=""mesh-container-content""><div class=""MazNVa comp-kjevao535 wixui-image rYiAuL"" id=""comp-kjevao535__29be10c7-1c28-4c5f-974c-d96805837f88"" title=""From his rescuer: Tully arrived in my yard in early Summer 2021.

wheezy-and-wonky,Wheezy and Wonky,11 month-old siblings,Need a home by 3/25,"Wheezy: Wheezy is a curious and fearless little kitten. She loves toys (especially chewing on her plush avocado) and is very serious about chasing her mouse or jingling balls. Wheezy will run full speed ahead despite her light “wheezy” breath. She has been given a round of antibiotics which has significantly helped her sneezing and wheezing. Wheezy is the first to explore new rooms and spaces and does occasionally attempt to bolt out the front door (so always be aware).When Wheezy is sleepy, she is quick to fold into your arms and loudly purr. Wheezy also loves to nibble on her brother’s ear when she is feeling especially cuddly and comfortable.  She enjoys litterboxes that are neat and tidy with taller sides for privacy.  In the past, Wheezy has relieved herself in the bathtub. However, when that is not an option (bathroom door closed), she eventually finds her way to the litterbox. Wheezy may be a tiny kitten, but she is mighty and makes her presence known. You cannot help but be enamored by Wheezy’s adorable face and feisty spirit. Wonky: Wonky may be the cuddliest kitten in the world. He must jump in your lap or be held whenever you get home from work/an outside activity. When Wonky is held, he immediately starts to suck his thumb and purr loudly. Just like a baby, sucking his thumb puts him right to sleep. He prefers to sleep on his human’s lap, chest, or neck. Whenever Wonky is not cuddling, he is eating or zooming through the apartment.Wonky is very social and loves to eat dry food when his humans are eating meals. His meals give him super cat speed, and he zooms through the apartment like a torpedo. Wonky enjoys chasing string toys and showing off his hunting/stalking instincts. Wonky will let you know when he needs attention with the sweetest “mew” and enjoys following his human wherever they may go. You cannot help but be smitten with this kitten’s loving and social personality. **** Pick the (cafe) option for pick up!****","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/7f467d_9125f655bd9c47cf9e8534f05028c268~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_551,h_440,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/Image-empty-state.png",https://bbawcfosterteam.wixsite.com/cats/avaliblecats/wheezy-and-wonky,"<div class=""comp-kjevao4x5 YzqVVZ wixui-repeater__item"" id=""comp-kjevao4x5__08dfe8b7-3d1d-435e-b310-f2b70c38961f""><div class=""MW5IWV"" data-hook=""bgLayers"" id=""bgLayers_comp-kjevao4x5""><div class=""LWbAav Kv1aVt"" data-testid=""colorUnderlay""></div><div class=""VgO9Yg"" id=""bgMedia_comp-kjevao4x5""></div></div><div class="""" data-mesh-id=""comp-kjevao4x5__08dfe8b7-3d1d-435e-b310-f2b70c38961finlineContent"" data-testid=""inline-content""><div data-mesh-id=""comp-kjevao4x5__08dfe8b7-3d1d-435e-b310-f2b70c38961finlineContent-gridContainer"" data-testid=""mesh-container-content""><div class=""MazNVa comp-kjevao535 wixui-image rYiAuL"" id=""comp-kjevao535__08dfe8b7-3d1d-435e-b310-f2b70c38961f"" title=""Wheezy: Wheezy is a curious and fearless little kitten.

She loves toys (especially chewing on her plush avocado) and is very serious about chasing her mouse or jingling balls. Wheezy will run full speed ahead despite her light “wheezy” breath. She has been given a round of antibiotics which has significantly helped her sneezing and wheezing. Wheezy is the first to explore new rooms and spaces and does occasionally attempt to bolt out the front door (so always be aware).<br/><br/>When Wheezy is sleepy, she is quick to fold into your arms and loudly purr. Wheezy also loves to nibble on her brother’s ear when she is feeling especially cuddly and comfortable.  She enjoys litterboxes that are neat and tidy with taller sides for privacy.  In the past, Wheezy has relieved herself in the bathtub. However, when that is not an option (bathroom door closed), she eventually finds her way to the litterbox. Wheezy may be a tiny kitten, but she is mighty and makes her presence known. You cannot help but be enamored by Wheezy’s adorable face and feisty spirit. <br/><br/>Wonky: Wonky may be the cuddliest kitten in the world. He must jump in your lap or be held whenever you get home from work/an outside activity. When Wonky is held, he immediately starts to suck his thumb and purr loudly. Just like a baby, sucking his thumb puts him right to sleep. He prefers to sleep on his human’s lap, chest, or neck. Whenever Wonky is not cuddling, he is eating or zooming through the apartment.<br/><br/>Wonky is very social and loves to eat dry food when his humans are eating meals. His meals give him super cat speed, and he zooms through the apartment like a torpedo. Wonky enjoys chasing string toys and showing off his hunting/stalking instincts. Wonky will let you know when he needs attention with the sweetest “mew” and enjoys following his human wherever they may go. You cannot help but be smitten with this kitten’s loving and social personality. <br/><br/>**** Pick the (cafe) option for pick up!****</span></span></p></div><div aria-disabled=""false"" class=""comp-kjevao5b3 R6ex7N"" id=""comp-kjevao5b3__08dfe8b7-3d1d-435e-b310-f2b70c38961f""><a aria-disabled=""false"" class=""kuTaGy wixui-button zKbzSQ"" data-testid=""linkElement"" href=""https://bbawcfosterteam.wixsite.com/cats/avaliblecats/wheezy-and-wonky"" target=""_self""><span class=""M3I7Z2 wixui-button__label"">Learn More &gt;&gt;</span></a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>",2023-03-20 18:15:03+00:00
