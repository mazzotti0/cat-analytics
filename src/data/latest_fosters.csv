She goes absolutely crazy for chicken treats and will climb onto your lap for one.

Earthquake (the brown tabby) sometimes can’t<br/>seem to get close enough to you (yes, he loves to spoon) and he will definitely let you know he<br/>is enjoying your company and belly rubs with his sweet purrs. The pair love to find entertainment<br/>around the house including watching reality TV alongside you. Firestorm (the black and white<br/>one) is the less confident one of the pair, but her more outgoing and chill brother is showing her<br/>that she can trust humans more and more everyday. They both love to play and eat Churus all<br/>day long.

stuart-and-thumbs-up,Stuart and Thumbs Up,6 month-old BFFs,Need a home by 3/11,"These two purr-machines are the sweetest guys you’ll ever meet. Although they were hesitant about each other at first, they are now inseparable. They are always seen snuggled up to each other in the kitty bed grooming each other. Stuart is a very brave man. As soon as you get near him, he purrs so loudly and rubs up against you for snuggles. He is a total lover. He always wants to play and hop up on laps. Thumbs Up is a little bit more cautious at first than his BFF – while the first to explore, he is a bit more nervous about pets and snuggles and is quick to run and hide. However, every day, he comes out of his shell a bit more, becoming more vocal and purring as soon as he is pet.Both of these little guys are VERY hungry, love playing with toy mice, and exploring the apartment. They don’t mind being picked up but don’t seem like they love to be held for that long. They get along great with the resident cat at their foster home, and it seems that they would do well with animals and children.

tully,Tully,3ish year-old tabby male,"Ready now, rescuer can meet you at the cafe","From his rescuer: Tully arrived in my yard in early Summer 2021.  He was full of scrappy young cat vibes, bold, and ready for a fight…and then he had one (with a raccoon!) and ended up with a bad leg bite! Luckily I had a neuter appt for him and we treated the leg, put him in a kennel to recover and he trashed the place like a proper rock star.  When he returned to my yard, he scared away all the females in the colony and had various escapades such as bringing me baby possums as gifts, getting stuck in a tree, and thinking of my raised bed as a giant litter box (who can blame him).  However, over the year and a half he’s been with me he’s softened. He’d weave in and out of my legs but was not pettable. He’d still give me the occasional hiss, wasn’t touchable (except a little while eating), and swatted when feeling threatened. He is food motivated and endlessly curious so we got him a treat ball to keep him busy while we gardened. He liked to think of my yard as his and he basically never left. He’d come to my window nightly and meow for attention (and to visit one of my cats).  Fast forward to one morning in December 2022 - I whistled to call Tully to breakfast and he came with a chattering drooling jaw and kept pawing at his mouth. We thought he’d been poisoned! I got him in a carrier and to the ER and they discovered he’d broken a tooth off to the gum line and has pretty bad dental disease. Poor guy was in terrible pain and likely had been for some time (I’d be cranky too with a mouth like that). Fortunately, through a series of amazing, helpful, and passionate rescue friends, I brought him inside and his dental work will be done soon. While he’s been in his kennel he’s changed a lot.  His energy, while still sometimes guarded, has become more friendly - he’s purring, kneading, and eating off of people’s fingers and I even taught him to sit! He deserves a chance to become a house cat. He can still get startled and swat, but he is a totally different cat.    He is absolutely unable to have another cat in the house - he gets very stressed. The holding space with cats in and out has been challenging for him. ** Select Foster Pick Up (Intake) when scheduling****","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/7f467d_a389bffa67804090a4b8726e9ac048d6~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_551,h_440,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/Image-empty-state.jpg",https://bbawcfosterteam.wixsite.com/cats/avaliblecats/tully,"<div class=""comp-kjevao4x5 YzqVVZ"" id=""comp-kjevao4x5__29be10c7-1c28-4c5f-974c-d96805837f88""><div class=""MW5IWV"" data-hook=""bgLayers"" id=""bgLayers_comp-kjevao4x5""><div class=""LWbAav Kv1aVt"" data-testid=""colorUnderlay""></div><div class=""VgO9Yg"" id=""bgMedia_comp-kjevao4x5""></div></div><div class="""" data-mesh-id=""comp-kjevao4x5__29be10c7-1c28-4c5f-974c-d96805837f88inlineContent"" data-testid=""inline-content""><div data-mesh-id=""comp-kjevao4x5__29be10c7-1c28-4c5f-974c-d96805837f88inlineContent-gridContainer"" data-testid=""mesh-container-content""><div class=""comp-kjevao535 MazNVa rYiAuL"" id=""comp-kjevao535__29be10c7-1c28-4c5f-974c-d96805837f88"" title=""From his rescuer: Tully arrived in my yard in early Summer 2021.  He was full of scrappy young cat vibes, bold, and ready for a fight…and then he had one (with a raccoon!) and ended up with a bad leg bite! Luckily I had a neuter appt for him and we treated the leg, put him in a kennel to recover and he trashed the place like a proper rock star.  

When he returned to my yard, he scared away all the females in the colony and had various escapades such as bringing me baby possums as gifts, getting stuck in a tree, and thinking of my raised bed as a giant litter box (who can blame him).  However, over the year and a half he’s been with me he’s softened. He’d weave in and out of my legs but was not pettable. He’d still give me the occasional hiss, wasn’t touchable (except a little while eating), and swatted when feeling threatened. He is food motivated and endlessly curious so we got him a treat ball to keep him busy while we gardened. He liked to think of my yard as his and he basically never left. He’d come to my window nightly and meow for attention (and to visit one of my cats).  

Fast forward to one morning in December 2022 - I whistled to call Tully to breakfast and he came with a chattering drooling jaw and kept pawing at his mouth. We thought he’d been poisoned! I got him in a carrier and to the ER and they discovered he’d broken a tooth off to the gum line and has pretty bad dental disease. Poor guy was in terrible pain and likely had been for some time (I’d be cranky too with a mouth like that). Fortunately, through a series of amazing, helpful, and passionate rescue friends, I brought him inside and his dental work will be done soon. While he’s been in his kennel he’s changed a lot.  His energy, while still sometimes guarded, has become more friendly - he’s purring, kneading, and eating off of people’s fingers and I even taught him to sit! He deserves a chance to become a house cat. He can still get startled and swat, but he is a totally different cat.   

 He is absolutely unable to have another cat in the house - he gets very stressed. The holding space with cats in and out has been challenging for him.
