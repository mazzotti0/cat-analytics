buffy,Buffy,2ish year old white and tabby lady,"Ready now, fosterer can meet you at the cafe","Buffy was found in a basement along with her 3 kittens, Willow, Xander and Oz. They were hungry, dirty, and covered in fleas, yet not scared of us. Apparently Buffy was once owned and then left behind, which would explain how social she is. She is extremely friendly and happy to have been rescued. She walked into the carrier without a problem.She's been doing well in foster - lots of energy and adores playing! She even plays fetch. From her foster: Buffy is a friendly tabby who enjoys exploring as well as taking long naps. She loves playing with toys, particularly wands and anything else with a string. She is comfortable with being picked up, but doesn’t like being held too long. She likes to roam around the home exploring every corner and climbing onto high places (think top of the refrigerator). Buffy is fond of treats, all shapes and sizes, as well as eating her meals on time and she’ll let you know if she’s hungry with some chirps. She seems pretty active and will likely do well in a home where she can get plenty of attention and may enjoy having a feline friend. She would most likely do best in a home without children as she can still be a bit skittish and nip when scared, but she is making great progress and is a total delight.Please note, Buffy has a lot of energy and can play rough!

castle,Castle,8 year-old tabby lady,Needs a home ASAP,"From her fosterer: Castle is the sweetest friend to have around the house. She might be a little slow to warm up to you at first, but once you have won her loyalty, this tabby won’t be afraid to follow you around, nudge, and nuzzle you. She will greet you at the door when you come home each day and will meow when she’s hungry or when she wants you to wake up and give her attention. She goes absolutely crazy for chicken treats and will climb onto your lap for one. Castle is independent, explorative, and confident, and a sweet household companion who takes great interest in all that her humans do.

dipsy-and-tinky-winky,Dipsy and Tinky Winky,1 year-old brother and sister,Need a home by May 5th,"From their current fosterer: These one-year-old playful balls of energy will have you laughing at their antics and will definitely make their presence felt in your home. They love to play, whether it’s chasing each other madly around during their morning and evening zoomies, or pouncing on each other during their daily wrestling matches. Like all young cats, they are fond of toys, boxes, and any small object they can bat around and play with. They enjoy spending time looking out the window, surveilling everything happening outside. (Watch out plants, they might like to use you as toys too!)Dipsy (black and white boy) is the braver, more inquisitive and more confident of the pair.. He loves snuggles, whether it’s being your big or little spoon, and regularly seeks out affection during the day. He trills to get your attention and frequently asks for pets. He’ll follow you from room to room, making sure you’re still there, and will often come when called.Tinky Winky (tabby girl) is the shyer of the pair and likes her space. She likes to interact on her own terms, and while not fond of pets, she does enjoy interacting with feet through the bed covers.They both love food and will come running as soon as they hear the crack of the food can or the rustle of the dry food bag. They’re wild about Churus - Dipsy, in particular, can sniff out a freshly opened packed from the other side of the apartment and will rush to get some into his belly immediately!

He is currently afraid of strangers and sudden actions, and needs to be in a patient home where his boundaries are respected. He will also thrive in a home where he gets a lot of active play time. With the right support, Elmo warms up quickly and wants to follow you around, protect you while you’re using the toilet, and help you with your chores by chasing the Swiffer. He also has the cutest little chirps.  </span></span></p></div><div aria-disabled=""false"" class=""comp-kjevao5b3 R6ex7N"" id=""comp-kjevao5b3__ccacd659-6e11-4af9-8a76-904aa89e443e""><a aria-disabled=""false"" class=""kuTaGy wixui-button zKbzSQ"" data-testid=""linkElement"" href=""https://bbawcfosterteam.wixsite.com/cats/avaliblecats/elmo"" target=""_self""><span class=""M3I7Z2 wixui-button__label"">Learn More &gt;&gt;</span></a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>",2023-07-08 18:05:07+00:00

Ro is a wonderful mother and very dedicated to her brood, keeping them ship-shape, and snacks. She's adoring of her human friends as well, but does not seem to like other cats. The kittens are all beginning to eat solid food so we're ready for them to head off to a foster family for a few weeks until they are ready for adoption in pairs.
