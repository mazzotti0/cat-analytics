If you want a social, attention-loving, and authoritative feline friend, Angelo is the cat for you! Angelo is FIV+ and will live a normal healthy and long life when provided with quality care such as a balanced diet and yearly wellness exams (like any cat).

He is a large, gray tabby with a bushy tail, tufted ears, and silky-soft fur. He also has an abnormally large head, which you will only get a true sense of once you start petting him. But you better not stop petting him. He’ll be disappointed if you do. This is a very sweet boy. He will glue himself to your side whenever you are anywhere he can find a comfy spot for himself and will even flop over onto your feet while you go to the bathroom. He only occasionally sits in laps, but considering his heft that’s probably a good thing. He meows very little (no morning yowling to wake you up) and purrs quietly but frequently. Just talk to him and he starts the motor and biscuit-making! He will absolutely want to sleep in your bed. In fact, the bed is his favorite place in the whole world. It allows him to sprawl out on his back, with all four legs in the air and his belly totally exposed, in the most shameless pose. It’s sort of dog-like. And speaking of dogs, he eats like one. Put his food out for him and by the time you turn back around, it’s gone. He’s not picky either. Gumshoe is also a chill cat. He rarely misbehaves, mostly keeps off counters and tables, scratches responsibly, and will only ask for attention in sweet, non-obnoxious ways. However, be aware that he does get middle-of-the-night zoomies and will tear around your home, chasing his favorite toys. You can almost tell time by his zoomies! Also, exercise caution while walking. He delights in tangling with ankles and he will appear between your feet as if out of nowhere. Gumshoe would do well with children. He tolerates annoyances and will only nip softly once he has reached his breaking point",2023-07-08 17:41:14+00:00

She’s spunky but calms easily, loves a belly rub or neck/chin tickle, and plays gently with her brother and fellow humans. Wagyu is more cautious, tinier, but equally as playful and full of sweetness from ears to tail. He loudly purrs the moment he’s stroked or picked up and the little motor doesn’t stop. He’s also the caretaker of the two, moving aside easily for his hungry sister, and grooms her whiskers and head when relaxing. Like the wag of a dog’s tail, Wagyu’s tireless purr will melt your heart. This 14 week old sibling pair were part of a larger litter slated to be sold to a pet store.

She’s also a renowned biscuit maker whose work ethic will wow you—even when tired, she still takes the time to knead. When they’ve spent their energy, they like nothing more than to curl up on your lap or intertwined together on the couch. They love pets, and Gooey likes some light bonks on the butt. Gooey also likes to simulate her own waterpark experience by splashing around in her water bowl sometimes, something Hazey doesn’t understand the appeal of.

Named after a giraffe due to his colors and length, this guy is just ready for affection and attention. He has a way of hugging you while you hold him and nestling into your neck. Melman is friendly, outgoing, affectionate, cuddly — and occasional suffers from outbreaks of single kitten/fratboy jerk syndrome. He loves to to explore and climb furniture and make sure nothing is precariously placed (such a helpful guy!). He follows his foster around the apartment when not receiving enough attention. He enjoys other cats, but has emphatically declined to share their home with any dogs. Although we don’t know his history, we suspect that Melman was raised as a single kitten and taught to play rough — which is why he is just now learning appropriate play behavior. While he does need his 20 hours of beauty sleep, he is otherwise pretty active and needs space and an appropriate cat companion for a good chase or wrestling match. Melman is generally kind and cuddly with humans (he is a total snuggle bug), but can get nippy without enough stimulation. When he decide it’s time to wrestle and play rough, he will happily choose you if not redirected to the appropriate playmate / cat toy with potentially painful consequences. Melman needs to go to an experienced home with someone who is able to understand and pay attention to cat body language and willing to create structure and boundaries AND with an active and assertive adult cat with similar play instincts and energy. No kids.",2023-07-08 17:41:14+00:00

They enjoy playing soccer with their catnip toys, chasing a laser, and zooming through the apartment with the cutest gallops. They are very treat motivated and will do cute tricks (like going for their scratching post instead of the couch) if they are rewarded. Mia (grey) is a curious and playful girl who loves to stalk toys around the apartment and chase her brother around when she’s bored. She is a real model who will strut around the apartment like it's her runway and show off her adorable white tail tip. She loves cuddles but on her own terms and will come up to you when she’s in the mood. Otherwise, she’ll curl up in her spot under the coffee table and nap the afternoon away at your feet while you work from home. Jules (tabby) is not the sharpest tool in the shed but more than makes up for it with his cuteness. He lets his sister take the lead on meeting new people or exploring bags and boxes that come into the apartment, but once he knows it’s safe, he’ll come out and investigate for himself too. Once he knows and trusts you, he will jump right up into your lap and purr loudly to express his love. Mia and Jules are both still a little bit skittish when it comes to loud noises or humans approaching them, but once they spend some time with you, they open up to become the cutest love bugs. They would probably do best in a calm and patient home so they can get to know and trust you in their own time.",2023-07-08 17:41:14+00:00

She does enjoy other cats, but after having spent time with so many she also values her alone time. Her favorite thing is food! She loves food so much that she sometimes needs a little help getting out her energy before meal time. Having a play session prior to eating helps her burn away that excess energy so she can enjoy her food, and so she might be a little more patient while you’re preparing it. Midnight Rain loves scritches and pets in short bursts, but make sure you check with her both before and during so she doesn’t get overstimulated. As you get to know her, you’ll be able to understand her body language so you’ll have a better idea of when she’s up to being pet and when she’d prefer some space. Because of this, she’d do better in a home without any kids. Curious and playful and a bit timid, Midnight Rain would be a wonderful companion.

One of his favorite moves is to stretch out on the kitchen floor in hopes he can convince you to shake out a few treats! He’s a great balance of cat napping laziness and mischievous fun.

He’s not a picky eater and loves his Temptations treats. His strength is using his senses to find something, so he likes when his foster throws the treat down the hallway so he can practice finding it. Recently, he’s enjoyed sitting on the windowsill and watching the birds and outside action on the street below. He’s been open and loving to other people who visit his temporary home. He’s so loyal and will typically follow his fosters around the apartment as they go about their day. All in all, Sporadic makes his people laugh all the time. He’s so sweet, and whoever adopts him will be lucky!",2023-07-08 17:41:14+00:00

She purrs so loud that you can hear her from across the room. Although she can be a real hide-and-seek player in the beginning, after she gets to know you, she will be with you everywhere around the house. Saint Cyr is more playful. He likes to explore and play with everything he can find (even a tissue). He is a real foodie and loves treats, but sometimes he will be more interested in human food than his own.
