# cat-analytics

There are two purposes of this repo:
1. monitor the current available cats on the Brooklyn cat cafe website. Overtime as this data is collected, the intent would be to understand how long cats are on the website before they get adopted. Once a rich enough dataset is built, then it will enable some analytics to understand which cats go faster and which take longer for adoption.
2. monitor the available foster cats list to understand when a new foster cat becomes available, then send an email alert
