She loves to play with her wand toys, and loves anything crinkly. If you’ve got a shoebox laying around, you can be sure to find her rolling around in it. Aeon loves to initiate pets by rubbing her face on your hand and calling out for you with her sweet voice. She sleeps at the foot of her fosters bed and has just started exploring the world of bedtime cuddles. She is a little particular about pets sometimes, but she will let you know with a gentle “no thank you”. Aeon is a bit timid about loud noises and would do best in a home with a quiet home without children or other pets. She takes a bit of time to come out of her shell, but she is well worth the wait!",2023-01-22 19:13:48+00:00

Her favorite toy is a ribbon wand toy and she’s not afraid to show her brother who’s boss by hogging the food bowl sometimes.",2023-01-22 19:13:48+00:00

While not as gregarious as her brother, Artemis is quite the clever girl and isn't about to let the boys push her around. She likes to carefully observe a situation before diving in. Treats both crunchy and churu tube go a long way in winning her over. They have both recently discovered the delight that is a cat tree and love watching birds and dragon flies from the window. With pink noses and toe beans, these kittens are two wonderful companions, sure to brighten whatever home they find themselves in.

A tuxedo with white handlebar mustaches from the Bronx, he might look tough but he will melt you with his tiny meow and Puss-in-Boots eyes. Bobsled loves play hunting with the wire wand and toys on ribbons. He will even stalk a yoga mat inched along the ground with your toes! He gets creative -- pretending not to care, or hiding under a chair…and then he strikes! He loves treats and might accidentally scratch if he gets too excited, but he is nothing but love. Bobsled nurses adorably on soft blankets and perches atop boxes. He will sit with you but he's not a lap cat (yet) - he will lounge nearby and send you loving blink kisses. He likes being pet from the shoulders back - he isn't on board with ear scritches yet. Bob is quiet and non-aggressive and might benefit from a mellow similar-age or slightly older feline companion to show him the ropes. He gets agitated when he hears dogs and may not do well with one in the home. He may do well in a home with older children if they can respect his need for space. Bobsled is in need of an echocardiogram due to having a heart murmur and we'd be happy to arrange an appointment at our next rescue clinic.",2023-01-22 19:13:48+00:00

Buffy is fond of treats, all shapes and sizes, as well as eating her meals on time and she’ll let you know if she’s hungry with some chirps. She seems pretty active and will likely do well in a home where she can get plenty of attention and may enjoy having a feline friend.

It doesn't take much to get him purring — just a simple touch or sitting next to him will get his motor roaring. He adores belly rubs and will throw himself on the floor and give you his belly. Cassava is a bit shyer, but loves attention on his own terms. He enjoys cuddling during bedtime and sleeping close to his person and getting gentle pet.

She will greet you at the door when you come home each day and will meow when she’s hungry or when she wants you to wake up and give her attention. She goes absolutely crazy for chicken treats and will climb onto your lap for one. Castle is independent, explorative, and confident, and a sweet household companion who takes great interest in all that her humans do. She does have some kidney issues, which are currently stable but requires a special food – which, luckily, she loves. Castle would make a great pet for any family. She is very low maintenance and mostly likes to lay in a soft bed and explore when it’s quiet, but she’s even happier when rubbing against her humans and being pet.

She can be a little reserved at first, hiding in the bathroom or finding a spot underneath the bed, but after a few weeks, she will follow you around and demand lots of pats and cuddles. She loves to watch TV with humans and even loves watching ice hockey (for whatever reason she will be glued to the TV and it’s rather funny- we think she’s a Rangers fan!) She enjoys playing with the cat wand and is NUTS for catnip. Overall, she’s very sweet and just wants to hang with the humans! Her little meow when she wants pats is the cutest thing ever.

He spends a lot of the day napping and lazing but will come out to socialize whenever you call for him, and likes to be underfoot wherever you are just so you know he’s there. Lately he’s been a fan of perching on top of the kitchen cabinets so he gets a good view of all the action. Corso loves bare feet and will rub his face on your toes! Scritches are very much welcomed as well, especially on the head and under the chin. Corso is a happy eater and litter box pro. While he’s not quite ready to crawl into your lap on his own, he’s open to being picked up and cuddled so maybe he’s close!

Understandably, he took some time to get settled, but is now a charming, cheeky fellow.  Although not much of a lapcat, he likes to keep tabs on his foster while they work from home and is sometimes very chatty with his kitty babbling. His favorite pastimes include chasing after a tennis ball, enjoying churu fresh from the tube, and lounging around the house. Just give him a chance and Cowboy will be a delightful companion to the right home. Plus, as a polydactyl cat, he's got some adorable thumbs.

Crest (grey with white belly and feet) is very curious and the adventurer of the bunch. She is the most cuddly and loves to steal all of the attention to get all of the pets. Colgate (brown tabby) is spunky and makes the cutest little expressions. Colgate loves playing with his sisters and could chase a toy on a string for hours. Oral B (grey with spots) has giant yellow/green eyes that will melt your heart. These kittens would love to be adopted as a trio. They have a sibling that tested positive for FeLV so can’t be adopted into a home with other cats until they can get retested when they are older.

These sisters also really love each other. You’ll find them snuggled up together and making biscuits on each other. They’re great with the resident cats, constantly coming up to their resident brother and rubbing against him until he gives them licks. Copy can be quite vocal when she wants attention and will let you know when she wants pets — you’ll quickly learn the range of chitters and polite meows she uses. She’s the alpha of the two and will climb up to you to insist you give her more affection. If you try to stop petting her she’ll nuzzle into your legs and let you know you’re not done! She’ll reward you for your pets with purrs and the occasional flop on her back for belly rubs! Cut is still learning to trust humans and will avoid being picked up, but once you have her in your arms and are petting her she will easily doze off. She also accepts love in the form of Churu cat treats! She’s incredibly playful and is more likely to be found running around with a mouse toy in her mouth than her sister.

You’ll find her cleaning up her siblings BFF Cuttlefish, making sure everyone is in tip-top shape to take charge of the day ahead. Cuttlefish has the most heart-warming, endearing round eyes. He’s still a bit unsure of us humans but is warming up a little bit more each day. You’ll find him first in line for breakfast and Churu. This cutie is now comfortable coming up into your lap so long as Churu is on the menu. This is when you can sneak a few quick pets in – soon enough he’ll be onboard for endless cuddles.

His hobbies include snuggling with stuffed animals, getting many pets and chin-scratches, and snoozing.  He has learned that he loves toys and especially loves the cat dancer.  We would guess that he would be a solid mouser, should that skill be necessary.  Daniel recently sat on his first lap, and likes to sit very close to whoever is petting him. He seems to like other cats and would be happy with a friend (although the resident cats in his foster home do not return the sentiment). He is a very special guy!

Earthquake (white with fascinating black splotches and soulful eyes) has been slower to appreciate the delight of snuggles but we’re sure that with a little more time and patience, she’ll continue to come out of her shell and be the most lovely and loving kitten around. In the meantime, Wildfire plays the protective brother by looking out for her and making sure she’s still involved in whatever games, explorations, and mischief that he gets up to. Both kittens have beautiful voices and call to each other in little chirps and cat songs when they’re playing or can’t find each other.

Although initially a bit shy when she meets someone new, she will just dash away into a safer spot and then wait to be followed for scritches. The person who takes the time to build trust with Emmy will have earned a silly sweetheart of a best friend. Emmy is energetic and playful and loves swatting toys around and finding fun games with curtains and rugs. She is patient when becoming friends with other cats, but is overjoyed when they are ready for a wrestling match or a good chase. She is currently living with a dog and doesn’t seem to mind. Emmy was rescued during the rain from outside of a playground in Fort Greene. The next day, tiny kittens were found on the opposite side of the playground, and we realized that they were her’s and Emmy was so relieved to be united with her babies. Now that they are older, she is enjoying the opportunity to be a kitten herself. Emmy would be happiest in a home with at least one other young and playful feline friend and would probably do well with polite young humans as well.

Stowaway (brown tabby) was rescued after hitching a ride in the chassis of two different cars. After a driving tour through central Brooklyn his last ride was brought to a local mechanic who kindly lifted the car and excavated Stowy. He hissed for about 10 minutes and has since been a non-stop purr machine. This boy is full of light and joy, eagerly greeting you with purrs and melty eyes as soon as you walk in the room asking to be picked up and pet. He loves to climb (even a leg will do though he is being discouraged from doing this), is thrilled with any wand toy and is a Churu fanatic. He finds joy in everything - a box, a scrap of paper, his own tail and is easily entertained and endlessly entertaining. Fennel (white and gray) is one of a large litter of kittens that were living under a gazebo in a large community garden underneath the 3 train tracks. More cautious than his BFF, he nevertheless begins to purr and nuzzle as soon as he is pet. This sweet boy has remarkably soft, silky fur, loves to chase toys that are thrown for him and is obsessed with little fish treats. Fennel, while still a little shy, is expressive about letting you know what he’s thinking - he meows when separated from Stowy, even for a little while, and lets out the most ridiculously sweet chirps when excited. If you’re looking for kittens that are equal parts charming, fun and loving, these are your boys!",2023-01-22 19:13:48+00:00

They love treats, chasing each other and playing with toys. They love to explore, and are particularly enamored by the sink, but also love finding the coziest spot to cuddle up for a nap together. These two are a bonded duo who really love each other, and are frequently checking-in on the other. Fifi is a black and white playful beauty who loves running laps and believes anything can be a toy if you use your imagination. She greets her foster parents by the door and demands pets immediately upon their homecoming- if you're not acknowledging her as quickly as she’d like, she will remind you through the cutest little cry and repeated head-butts. Rufus also loves to play and explore, but often prefers to cuddle up with resident cats and demand a bath from them. His people-love can easily be bought with tasty treats once he's taken a few days to make sure you're a friend not foe. If you’ve passed his test he will start sneaking into bed to cuddle you (only after you’ve fallen asleep and he’s worked up some courage). Fifi and Rufus are a shy quirky duo but that doesn’t mean they aren’t loving and affectionate in their own ways. Fifi loves to be pet and played with, but isn’t yet a cuddler. Rufus started off like a hissy little punk, but quickly became a cuddling purr machine (on his terms). Fifi and Rufus would excel in a quiet home with someone willing to give them the time they need to acclimate and blossom. They have a lot of love to give and are the source of many smiles and laughs in their foster home.",2023-01-22 19:13:48+00:00

She’s learning to enjoy pets and has the sweetest mews. She also loves to sit in the window and eventually at the end of your bed to warm your feet!

They were trapped in a yard with 20 other cats and the owner asked that all of them be euthanized. Of course, that wasn’t happening and we were happy to snap them up and introduce them to the good, warm, treat-filled, life. These four kittens may have begun as tiny hissy monsters, but now they are playful and snuggly (especially if you happen to have a can of food handy or, even more especially, churu treats). Young Goodman Brown was the first to realize humans were really just giant vehicles for treat dispensing and pets. He’s also a champ with the wand toy and a scourge to toy mice everywhere. Feathertop is the brave explorer of the bunch, always keen to find the highest perch or sneak out of his foster room to chirrup agreeably at the horrified resident cats. Blithedale Romance is a very charming calico who took a bit to come around but is now a happy snuggler. The Great Carbuncle is a relatively rare orange lady cat. Terrible eye infections before she was rescued have made her eyes slightly cloudy but she sees well and is just as likely to pounce on a flying toy as her siblings.

Melman is generally kind and cuddly with humans (he is a total snuggle bug), but can get nippy without enough stimulation. When he decide it’s time to wrestle and play rough, he will happily choose you if not redirected to the appropriate playmate / cat toy with potentially painful consequences. Melman needs to go to an experienced home with someone who is able to understand and pay attention to cat body language and willing to create structure and boundaries AND with an active and assertive adult cat with similar play instincts and energy.

She is playful and lively, but her greatest joy comes from sitting atop your shoulder or nuzzling in your lap. She is not fickle about who she befriends and everyone she encounters instantly takes a shine to her!",2023-01-22 19:13:48+00:00

He also has a love-heart on the roof of his mouth, which is very apt because he will be your mini shadow of love. Way is conventionally adorable and gets away with many naughty things because of her good looks and charming demeanor. She is very curious, energetic, loves to climb (and fall), short attention span, and a little more hyperactive compare to Will. If Will is giving you his attention, Way likes to barge right in and demands she’s part of the party! Once she’s done being adventurous and playful, Way has her calm side. She’s a snuggle bug and is, in fact, a really great cuddle buddy.

He must jump in your lap or be held whenever you get home from work/an outside activity. When Wonky is held, he immediately starts to suck his thumb and purr loudly. Just like a baby, sucking his thumb puts him right to sleep. He prefers to sleep on his human’s lap, chest, or neck. Whenever Wonky is not cuddling, he is eating or zooming through the apartment. Wonky is very social and loves to eat dry food when his humans are eating meals. His meals give him super cat speed, and he zooms through the apartment like a torpedo. Wonky enjoys chasing string toys and showing off his hunting/stalking instincts. Wonky will let you know when he needs attention with the sweetest “mew” and enjoys following his human wherever they may go. You cannot help but be smitten with this kitten’s loving and social personality. Wheezy is a curious and fearless little kitten. She loves toys (especially chewing on her plush avocado) and is very serious about chasing her mouse or jingling balls. Wheezy will run full speed ahead despite her light “wheezy” breath. She has been given a round of antibiotics which has significantly helped her sneezing and wheezing. Wheezy is the first to explore new rooms and spaces and does occasionally attempt to bolt out the front door (so always be aware). When Wheezy is sleepy, she is quick to fold into your arms and loudly purr. Wheezy also loves to nibble on her brother’s ear when she is feeling especially cuddly and comfortable. She enjoys litterboxes that are neat and tidy with taller sides for privacy. In the past, Wheezy has relieved herself in the bathtub. However, when that is not an option (bathroom door closed), she eventually finds her way to the litterbox. Wheezy may be a tiny kitten, but she is mighty and makes her presence known. You cannot help but be enamored by Wheezy’s adorable face and feisty spirit.",2023-01-22 19:13:48+00:00

Bobsled nurses adorably on soft blankets and perches atop boxes. He will sit with you but he's not a lap cat (yet) - he will lounge nearby and send you loving blink kisses. He likes being pet from the shoulders back - he isn't on board with ear scritches yet. Bob is quiet and non-aggressive and might benefit from a mellow similar-age or slightly older feline companion to show him the ropes. He gets agitated when he hears dogs and may not do well with one in the home. He may do well in a home with older children if they can respect his need for space.

Rachel Ray (smaller, brown nose) is most definitely not the brains of the operation, but she makes up for it in cuteness. Her favorite toy is currently a plastic fork and she will scream nonstop when she can't find her brother.

Although initially a bit shy when she meets someone new, she will just dash away into a safer spot and then wait to be followed for scritches. The person who takes the time to build trust with Emmy will have earned a silly sweetheart of a best friend. Emmy is energetic and playful and loves swatting toys around and finding fun games with curtains and rugs. She is patient when becoming friends with other cats, but is overjoyed when they are ready for a wrestling match or a good chase. She is currently living with a dog and doesn’t seem to mind. Emmy was rescued during the rain from outside of a playground in Fort Greene. The next day, tiny kittens were found on the opposite side of the playground, and we realized that they were her’s and Emmy was so relieved to be united with her babies. Now that they are older, she is enjoying the opportunity to be a kitten herself. Emmy would be happiest in a home with at least one other young and playful feline friend and would probably do well with polite young humans as well.

Stowaway (brown tabby) was rescued after hitching a ride in the chassis of two different cars. After a driving tour through central Brooklyn his last ride was brought to a local mechanic who kindly lifted the car and excavated Stowy. He hissed for about 10 minutes and has since been a non-stop purr machine. This boy is full of light and joy, eagerly greeting you with purrs and melty eyes as soon as you walk in the room asking to be picked up and pet. He loves to climb (even a leg will do though he is being discouraged from doing this), is thrilled with any wand toy and is a Churu fanatic. He finds joy in everything - a box, a scrap of paper, his own tail and is easily entertained and endlessly entertaining. Fennel (white and gray) is one of a large litter of kittens that were living under a gazebo in a large community garden underneath the 3 train tracks. More cautious than his BFF, he nevertheless begins to purr and nuzzle as soon as he is pet. This sweet boy has remarkably soft, silky fur, loves to chase toys that are thrown for him and is obsessed with little fish treats. Fennel, while still a little shy, is expressive about letting you know what he’s thinking - he meows when separated from Stowy, even for a little while, and lets out the most ridiculously sweet chirps when excited.

These two are a bonded duo who really love each other, and are frequently checking-in on the other. Fifi is a black and white playful beauty who loves running laps and believes anything can be a toy if you use your imagination. She greets her foster parents by the door and demands pets immediately upon their homecoming- if you're not acknowledging her as quickly as she’d like, she will remind you through the cutest little cry and repeated head-butts. Rufus also loves to play and explore, but often prefers to cuddle up with resident cats and demand a bath from them. His people-love can easily be bought with tasty treats once he's taken a few days to make sure you're a friend not foe. If you’ve passed his test he will start sneaking into bed to cuddle you (only after you’ve fallen asleep and he’s worked up some courage). Fifi and Rufus are a shy quirky duo but that doesn’t mean they aren’t loving and affectionate in their own ways. Fifi loves to be pet and played with, but isn’t yet a cuddler. Rufus started off like a hissy little punk, but quickly became a cuddling purr machine (on his terms). Fifi and Rufus would excel in a quiet home with someone willing to give them the time they need to acclimate and blossom.

Zapps is more timid, but she has a big personality once she’s comfortable. She loves making biscuits on a cozy poof/pillow and running from end to end of the apartment. She’s learning to enjoy pets and has the sweetest mews. She also loves to sit in the window and eventually at the end of your bed to warm your feet!

These four kittens may have begun as tiny hissy monsters, but now they are playful and snuggly (especially if you happen to have a can of food handy or, even more especially, churu treats). Young Goodman Brown was the first to realize humans were really just giant vehicles for treat dispensing and pets. He’s also a champ with the wand toy and a scourge to toy mice everywhere. Feathertop is the brave explorer of the bunch, always keen to find the highest perch or sneak out of his foster room to chirrup agreeably at the horrified resident cats. Blithedale Romance is a very charming calico who took a bit to come around but is now a happy snuggler. The Great Carbuncle is a relatively rare orange lady cat. Terrible eye infections before she was rescued have made her eyes slightly cloudy but she sees well and is just as likely to pounce on a flying toy as her siblings.

Wheezy is the first to explore new rooms and spaces and does occasionally attempt to bolt out the front door (so always be aware). When Wheezy is sleepy, she is quick to fold into your arms and loudly purr. Wheezy also loves to nibble on her brother’s ear when she is feeling especially cuddly and comfortable. She enjoys litterboxes that are neat and tidy with taller sides for privacy. In the past, Wheezy has relieved herself in the bathtub. However, when that is not an option (bathroom door closed), she eventually finds her way to the litterbox. Wheezy may be a tiny kitten, but she is mighty and makes her presence known.

He’s still a bit unsure of us humans but is warming up a little bit more each day. You’ll find him first in line for breakfast and Churu. This cutie is now comfortable coming up into your lap so long as Churu is on the menu. This is when you can sneak a few quick pets in – soon enough he’ll be onboard for endless cuddles. He’s the athlete of the family and loves to play with a string toy or kick a ball around (do we have our next international futbol star?!).",2023-01-22 19:51:39+00:00

Daniel Tiger is a beautiful, chunky, pet-loving cat with a very loud, deep purr.  He recently became an indoor cat and is adjusting so well – his litter box habits are impeccable, he loves pets, and he is very sweet.  His hobbies include snuggling with stuffed animals, getting many pets and chin-scratches, and snoozing.  He has learned that he loves toys and especially loves the cat dancer.  We would guess that he would be a solid mouser, should that skill be necessary.  Daniel recently sat on his first lap, and likes to sit very close to whoever is petting him. He seems to like other cats and would be happy with a friend (although the resident cats in his foster home do not return the sentiment). He is a very special guy! Daniel is in need of dental surgery and we are hoping his adopters can help cover the cost – we’re happy to talk more about this!",2023-01-22 19:51:39+00:00

Their current owner rescued them outdoors as kittens but a parent who is allergic to cats is moving in with the family and she can no longer keep them. Lulu is missing her right front paw, but it has caused her no trouble at all. Dolly and Lulu are spayed and up to date on vaccines. Both cats will need some extra medical care.

In the meantime, Wildfire plays the protective brother by looking out for her and making sure she’s still involved in whatever games, explorations, and mischief that he gets up to.

The person who takes the time to build trust with Emmy will have earned a silly sweetheart of a best friend. Emmy is energetic and playful and loves swatting toys around and finding fun games with curtains and rugs. She is patient when becoming friends with other cats, but is overjoyed when they are ready for a wrestling match or a good chase. She is currently living with a dog and doesn’t seem to mind. Emmy was rescued during the rain from outside of a playground in Fort Greene. The next day, tiny kittens were found on the opposite side of the playground, and we realized that they were her’s and Emmy was so relieved to be united with her babies. Now that they are older, she is enjoying the opportunity to be a kitten herself. Emmy would be happiest in a home with at least one other young and playful feline friend and would probably do well with polite young humans as well.

Stowaway (brown tabby) was rescued after hitching a ride in the chassis of two different cars. After a driving tour through central Brooklyn his last ride was brought to a local mechanic who kindly lifted the car and excavated Stowy. He hissed for about 10 minutes and has since been a non-stop purr machine. This boy is full of light and joy, eagerly greeting you with purrs and melty eyes as soon as you walk in the room asking to be picked up and pet. He loves to climb (even a leg will do though he is being discouraged from doing this), is thrilled with any wand toy and is a Churu fanatic. He finds joy in everything - a box, a scrap of paper, his own tail and is easily entertained and endlessly entertaining. Fennel (white and gray) is one of a large litter of kittens that were living under a gazebo in a large community garden underneath the 3 train tracks. More cautious than his BFF, he nevertheless begins to purr and nuzzle as soon as he is pet. This sweet boy has remarkably soft, silky fur, loves to chase toys that are thrown for him and is obsessed with little fish treats. Fennel, while still a little shy, is expressive about letting you know what he’s thinking - he meows when separated from Stowy, even for a little while, and lets out the most ridiculously sweet chirps when excited.

These two are a bonded duo who really love each other, and are frequently checking-in on the other. Fifi is a black and white playful beauty who loves running laps and believes anything can be a toy if you use your imagination. She greets her foster parents by the door and demands pets immediately upon their homecoming- if you're not acknowledging her as quickly as she’d like, she will remind you through the cutest little cry and repeated head-butts. Rufus also loves to play and explore, but often prefers to cuddle up with resident cats and demand a bath from them. His people-love can easily be bought with tasty treats once he's taken a few days to make sure you're a friend not foe. If you’ve passed his test he will start sneaking into bed to cuddle you (only after you’ve fallen asleep and he’s worked up some courage). Fifi and Rufus are a shy quirky duo but that doesn’t mean they aren’t loving and affectionate in their own ways. Fifi loves to be pet and played with, but isn’t yet a cuddler.

He enjoys lounging around and looking out the window or snuggling up in a suitcase under the bed.  If given the opportunity to snuggle with humans, he will most likely jump right in, although he's still fairly shy and tentative so it does take some patience to get him out of his shell. He has zero interest in snuggling (or doing anything else for that matter) with other cats, and must be the only cat in the home. A crucial aspect of Don Steele is that he is the sworn enemy of all TVs or large screens of that nature. The minute the TV goes on, he looks up terrified at the TV like ""YOU AGAIN! How did you find me here?! You'll never get me!!!"" and then either he ducks under the bed or runs from the room in total terror. (He is specifically ultra-disturbed by the Roku jungle screensaver.) He's been working on building up screen tolerance in foster, but has only made it up to tolerance of a 13"" computer screen. Thus, he's probably best suited to someone who does not watch a ton of TV/doesn't have one of those magic mirror gyms where the mirror comes to life as a person.",2023-01-22 19:51:39+00:00

Wonky is very social and loves to eat dry food when his humans are eating meals. His meals give him super cat speed, and he zooms through the apartment like a torpedo.

Wonky will let you know when he needs attention with the sweetest “mew” and enjoys following his human wherever they may go. You cannot help but be smitten with this kitten’s loving and social personality. Wheezy is a curious and fearless little kitten. She loves toys (especially chewing on her plush avocado) and is very serious about chasing her mouse or jingling balls. Wheezy will run full speed ahead despite her light “wheezy” breath. She has been given a round of antibiotics which has significantly helped her sneezing and wheezing. Wheezy is the first to explore new rooms and spaces and does occasionally attempt to bolt out the front door (so always be aware). When Wheezy is sleepy, she is quick to fold into your arms and loudly purr. Wheezy also loves to nibble on her brother’s ear when she is feeling especially cuddly and comfortable. She enjoys litterboxes that are neat and tidy with taller sides for privacy. In the past, Wheezy has relieved herself in the bathtub. However, when that is not an option (bathroom door closed), she eventually finds her way to the litterbox. Wheezy may be a tiny kitten, but she is mighty and makes her presence known.

Bob is quiet and non-aggressive and might benefit from a mellow similar-age or slightly older feline companion to show him the ropes.

She loves to watch TV with humans and even loves watching ice hockey (for whatever reason she will be glued to the TV and it’s rather funny- we think she’s a Rangers fan!) She enjoys playing with the cat wand and is NUTS for catnip. Overall, she’s very sweet and just wants to hang with the humans! Her little meow when she wants pats is the cutest thing ever.

He spends a lot of the day napping and lazing but will come out to socialize whenever you call for him, and likes to be underfoot wherever you are just so you know he’s there. Lately he’s been a fan of perching on top of the kitchen cabinets so he gets a good view of all the action. Corso loves bare feet and will rub his face on your toes! Scritches are very much welcomed as well, especially on the head and under the chin. Corso is a happy eater and litter box pro. While he’s not quite ready to crawl into your lap on his own, he’s open to being picked up and cuddled so maybe he’s close! He’s curious about windows and will try to climb them to check out the views.

His hobbies include snuggling with stuffed animals, getting many pets and chin-scratches, and snoozing.  He has learned that he loves toys and especially loves the cat dancer.  We would guess that he would be a solid mouser, should that skill be necessary.  Daniel recently sat on his first lap, and likes to sit very close to whoever is petting him. He seems to like other cats and would be happy with a friend (although the resident cats in his foster home do not return the sentiment). He is a very special guy!

In the meantime, Wildfire plays the protective brother by looking out for her and making sure she’s still involved in whatever games, explorations, and mischief that he gets up to.

She is patient when becoming friends with other cats, but is overjoyed when they are ready for a wrestling match or a good chase. She is currently living with a dog and doesn’t seem to mind. Emmy was rescued during the rain from outside of a playground in Fort Greene. The next day, tiny kittens were found on the opposite side of the playground, and we realized that they were her’s and Emmy was so relieved to be united with her babies. Now that they are older, she is enjoying the opportunity to be a kitten herself.

Fennel (white and gray) is one of a large litter of kittens that were living under a gazebo in a large community garden underneath the 3 train tracks. More cautious than his BFF, he nevertheless begins to purr and nuzzle as soon as he is pet.

Fifi is a black and white playful beauty who loves running laps and believes anything can be a toy if you use your imagination. She greets her foster parents by the door and demands pets immediately upon their homecoming- if you're not acknowledging her as quickly as she’d like, she will remind you through the cutest little cry and repeated head-butts. Rufus also loves to play and explore, but often prefers to cuddle up with resident cats and demand a bath from them. His people-love can easily be bought with tasty treats once he's taken a few days to make sure you're a friend not foe. If you’ve passed his test he will start sneaking into bed to cuddle you (only after you’ve fallen asleep and he’s worked up some courage). Fifi and Rufus are a shy quirky duo but that doesn’t mean they aren’t loving and affectionate in their own ways. Fifi loves to be pet and played with, but isn’t yet a cuddler.

Although she can be a real hide-and-seek player in the beginning, after she gets to know you, she will be with you everywhere around the house. Saint Cyr is more playful. He likes to explore and play with everything he can find (even a tissue). He is a real foodie and loves treats, but sometimes he will be more interested in human food than his own.

He enjoys lounging around and looking out the window or snuggling up in a suitcase under the bed.  If given the opportunity to snuggle with humans, he will most likely jump right in, although he's still fairly shy and tentative so it does take some patience to get him out of his shell. He has zero interest in snuggling (or doing anything else for that matter) with other cats, and must be the only cat in the home. A crucial aspect of Don Steele is that he is the sworn enemy of all TVs or large screens of that nature. The minute the TV goes on, he looks up terrified at the TV like ""YOU AGAIN! How did you find me here?! You'll never get me!!!"" and then either he ducks under the bed or runs from the room in total terror. (He is specifically ultra-disturbed by the Roku jungle screensaver.) He's been working on building up screen tolerance in foster, but has only made it up to tolerance of a 13"" computer screen. Thus, he's probably best suited to someone who does not watch a ton of TV/doesn't have one of those magic mirror gyms where the mirror comes to life as a person.",2023-01-22 20:23:11+00:00

Wonky is very social and loves to eat dry food when his humans are eating meals. His meals give him super cat speed, and he zooms through the apartment like a torpedo. Wonky enjoys chasing string toys and showing off his hunting/stalking instincts. Wonky will let you know when he needs attention with the sweetest “mew” and enjoys following his human wherever they may go. You cannot help but be smitten with this kitten’s loving and social personality. Wheezy is a curious and fearless little kitten. She loves toys (especially chewing on her plush avocado) and is very serious about chasing her mouse or jingling balls. Wheezy will run full speed ahead despite her light “wheezy” breath. She has been given a round of antibiotics which has significantly helped her sneezing and wheezing. Wheezy is the first to explore new rooms and spaces and does occasionally attempt to bolt out the front door (so always be aware). When Wheezy is sleepy, she is quick to fold into your arms and loudly purr. Wheezy also loves to nibble on her brother’s ear when she is feeling especially cuddly and comfortable. She enjoys litterboxes that are neat and tidy with taller sides for privacy. In the past, Wheezy has relieved herself in the bathtub.
