This boy also loves to chill and will hang out on the couch or bed and just vibe while his humans watch TV. Brillo adores any feather wand toy and loves swatting and grabbing toys that he can bite. He’s also keen on running around the apartment swatting and chasing toys. He’s a sweet, silly cow with a big personality who loves to eat! Brillo is totally fine around other cats and strangers. Adopt this sweet friend for a wonderful addition to the family!!!!Please note that he is on some meds to support his liver function.

From her rescuer: Olive is a very affectionate girl, estimated by the vet to be around 5.5 to 6 months old. Olive is cat who really enjoys human company and to stay in arms and laps. She is still adjusting to engage with toys demonstrating to be very interested in feathered wands. Olive was rescued by a caseworker who knew she was left behind by her family. For 9 days, Olive stayed alone, in the apt, without any source of food and water. She is a little underweight but eating like a champ and with tons of love to give to whoever is willing to receive it. No signs of any type of aggression in her tiny body.Understandably, Olive doesn’t like to be alone for a long time and can become vocal if she needs attention. We bet she'd love a cat or dog friend!She is litter trained and got fully vetted after her rescue. Olive’s former family had two very young children; witnesses stated that Olive was excellent with them.

tully,,,,,,,,Tully,3ish year-old tabby male,"Ready now, rescuer can meet you at the cafe","From his rescuer: Tully arrived in my yard in early Summer 2021.  He was full of scrappy young cat vibes, bold, and ready for a fight…and then he had one (with a raccoon!) and ended up with a bad leg bite! Luckily I had a neuter appt for him and we treated the leg, put him in a kennel to recover and he trashed the place like a proper rock star.  When he returned to my yard, he scared away all the females in the colony and had various escapades such as bringing me baby possums as gifts, getting stuck in a tree, and thinking of my raised bed as a giant litter box (who can blame him).  However, over the year and a half he’s been with me he’s softened. He’d weave in and out of my legs but was not pettable. He’d still give me the occasional hiss, wasn’t touchable (except a little while eating), and swatted when feeling threatened. He is food motivated and endlessly curious so we got him a treat ball to keep him busy while we gardened. He liked to think of my yard as his and he basically never left. He’d come to my window nightly and meow for attention (and to visit one of my cats).  Fast forward to one morning in December 2022 - I whistled to call Tully to breakfast and he came with a chattering drooling jaw and kept pawing at his mouth. We thought he’d been poisoned! I got him in a carrier and to the ER and they discovered he’d broken a tooth off to the gum line and has pretty bad dental disease. Poor guy was in terrible pain and likely had been for some time (I’d be cranky too with a mouth like that). Fortunately, through a series of amazing, helpful, and passionate rescue friends, I brought him inside and his dental work will be done soon. While he’s been in his kennel he’s changed a lot.  His energy, while still sometimes guarded, has become more friendly - he’s purring, kneading, and eating off of people’s fingers and I even taught him to sit! He deserves a chance to become a house cat. He can still get startled and swat, but he is a totally different cat.    He is absolutely unable to have another cat in the house - he gets very stressed. The holding space with cats in and out has been challenging for him. ** Select Foster Pick Up (Intake) when scheduling****","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/7f467d_a389bffa67804090a4b8726e9ac048d6~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_551,h_440,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/Image-empty-state.jpg",https://bbawcfosterteam.wixsite.com/cats/avaliblecats/tully,2023-03-11 18:27:10+00:00,True,True,True,True,True,True,True,row_added

buffy,,,,,,,,Buffy,2ish year old white and tabby lady,"Ready now, fosterer can meet you at the cafe","Buffy was found in a basement along with her 3 kittens, Willow, Xander and Oz. They were hungry, dirty, and covered in fleas, yet not scared of us. Apparently Buffy was once owned and then left behind, which would explain how social she is. She is extremely friendly and happy to have been rescued. She walked into the carrier without a problem.She's been doing great in foster - lots of energy and adores playing! She even plays fetch. From her foster: Buffy is a friendly tabby who enjoys exploring as well as taking long naps. She loves playing with toys, particularly wands and anything else with a string. She is comfortable with being picked up, but doesn’t like being held too long. She likes to roam around the home exploring every corner and climbing onto high places (think top of the refrigerator). Buffy is fond of treats, all shapes and sizes, as well as eating her meals on time and she’ll let you know if she’s hungry with some chirps. She seems pretty active and will likely do well in a home where she can get plenty of attention and may enjoy having a feline friend. She would most likely do best in a home without children as she can still be a bit skittish and nip when scared, but she is making great progress and is a total delight.Please note, Buffy has a lot of energy and can play rough!

stuart-and-thumbs-up,Stuart and Thumbs Up,6 month-old BFFs,Need a home by 3/11,"These two purr-machines are the sweetest guys you’ll ever meet. Although they were hesitant about each other at first, they are now inseparable. They are always seen snuggled up to each other in the kitty bed grooming each other. Stuart is a very brave man. As soon as you get near him, he purrs so loudly and rubs up against you for snuggles. He is a total lover. He always wants to play and hop up on laps. Thumbs Up is a little bit more cautious at first than his BFF – while the first to explore, he is a bit more nervous about pets and snuggles and is quick to run and hide. However, every day, he comes out of his shell a bit more, becoming more vocal and purring as soon as he is pet.Both of these little guys are VERY hungry, love playing with toy mice, and exploring the apartment.

tully,Tully,3ish year-old tabby male,"Ready now, rescuer can meet you at the cafe","From his rescuer: Tully arrived in my yard in early Summer 2021.  He was full of scrappy young cat vibes, bold, and ready for a fight…and then he had one (with a raccoon!) and ended up with a bad leg bite! Luckily I had a neuter appt for him and we treated the leg, put him in a kennel to recover and he trashed the place like a proper rock star.  When he returned to my yard, he scared away all the females in the colony and had various escapades such as bringing me baby possums as gifts, getting stuck in a tree, and thinking of my raised bed as a giant litter box (who can blame him).  However, over the year and a half he’s been with me he’s softened. He’d weave in and out of my legs but was not pettable. He’d still give me the occasional hiss, wasn’t touchable (except a little while eating), and swatted when feeling threatened. He is food motivated and endlessly curious so we got him a treat ball to keep him busy while we gardened. He liked to think of my yard as his and he basically never left. He’d come to my window nightly and meow for attention (and to visit one of my cats).  Fast forward to one morning in December 2022 - I whistled to call Tully to breakfast and he came with a chattering drooling jaw and kept pawing at his mouth. We thought he’d been poisoned! I got him in a carrier and to the ER and they discovered he’d broken a tooth off to the gum line and has pretty bad dental disease. Poor guy was in terrible pain and likely had been for some time (I’d be cranky too with a mouth like that). Fortunately, through a series of amazing, helpful, and passionate rescue friends, I brought him inside and his dental work will be done soon. While he’s been in his kennel he’s changed a lot.  His energy, while still sometimes guarded, has become more friendly - he’s purring, kneading, and eating off of people’s fingers and I even taught him to sit! He deserves a chance to become a house cat. He can still get startled and swat, but he is a totally different cat.    He is absolutely unable to have another cat in the house - he gets very stressed. The holding space with cats in and out has been challenging for him. ** Select Foster Pick Up (Intake) when scheduling****","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/7f467d_a389bffa67804090a4b8726e9ac048d6~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_551,h_440,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/Image-empty-state.jpg",https://bbawcfosterteam.wixsite.com/cats/avaliblecats/tully,2023-03-17 23:38:25+00:00,Tully (reserved),3ish year-old tabby male,"Ready now, rescuer can meet you at the cafe","From his rescuer: Tully arrived in my yard in early Summer 2021.

This 19 lb lady was living with a person who's own issues prevented them from taking good care of her. Ultimately they worked really hard to make sure she ended up with us in the hopes she'd have a better life. While her weight is something we need to address, it's not anything taxing for you! We're just going to work on her transitioning to an all wet diet (as much as she wants) so that she can slowly get to a healthy weight.

stuart-and-thumbs-up,Stuart and Thumbs Up (reserved),6 month-old BFFs,Need a home by 3/11,"These two purr-machines are the sweetest guys you’ll ever meet. Although they were hesitant about each other at first, they are now inseparable. They are always seen snuggled up to each other in the kitty bed grooming each other. Stuart is a very brave man. As soon as you get near him, he purrs so loudly and rubs up against you for snuggles. He is a total lover. He always wants to play and hop up on laps. Thumbs Up is a little bit more cautious at first than his BFF – while the first to explore, he is a bit more nervous about pets and snuggles and is quick to run and hide. However, every day, he comes out of his shell a bit more, becoming more vocal and purring as soon as he is pet.Both of these little guys are VERY hungry, love playing with toy mice, and exploring the apartment. They don’t mind being picked up but don’t seem like they love to be held for that long. They get along great with the resident cat at their foster home, and it seems that they would do well with animals and children. They are the sweetest love-bugs ever and would be such a wonderful addition to any home!Please note that Stuart has one small spot of ringworm, it's being treated with oral meds!** Select Foster Pick Up (Cafe) when scheduling****","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/7f467d_164b280f2f0a4cac8e9dc6eb57e73481~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_551,h_440,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/Image-empty-state.jpg",https://bbawcfosterteam.wixsite.com/cats/avaliblecats/stuart-and-thumbs-up-(reserved),2023-03-20 04:54:19+00:00,,,,,,,,True,True,True,True,True,True,True,row_deleted

They spent several of their early months in a crate. But they have completely healed (except for some minor scarring in their eye) and they have discovered the joys of life outside of a crate. Small Fries (orange tabby) is no longer small. He has become quite the cuddlebug! He makes a great sleeping companion and quite enjoys pets. He has a moderate level of energy, so he’s neither bouncing off the walls or a total cat bed potato. The perfect level of kitten playfulness and zen. Cheeseburger could definitely be a kitty model. She is a dilute tabby with faint shades of orange, including a slice of cheddar cheese on her forehead. She enjoys pets before dinnertime and laying around like she owns the place.These shyer kittens would do well in a quiet household, perhaps with very friendly cats. They may do well with patient children, but may not do well with a dog.","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/7f467d_cbb2b7477ad944a3bd1aaf6970059bde~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_551,h_440,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/Image-empty-state.png",https://bbawcfosterteam.wixsite.com/cats/avaliblecats/cheeseburger-and-small-fries,2023-03-20 18:05:03+00:00,True,True,True,True,True,True,True,row_added

They spent several of their early months in a crate. But they have completely healed (except for some minor scarring in their eye) and they have discovered the joys of life outside of a crate. McChicken (tabby) and Sausage Burrito (gray) are a really special pair. They are extraordinarily cuddly and friendly. They love cuddles, kisses, and pets. And boy, do they love to play!Sausage Burrito is the runt of the litter, but don’t let her size fool you. She can wrestle with the best of them and could race a greyhound. She is quite petite, lean, and athletic. She loves scritches on her tiny head and pets and cuddling.McChicken is extremely, extremely cuddly. He has a bit of scarring on his eyes due to early eye infections. But he doesn’t let anything stand in his way! If he were a person, I’m sure that he would be quite the adventurer. Skydiving off cliffs and climbing Mt. Everest. His joy and zest for life is infectious. His fur is very soft and he is quite loyal to both cats and humans.These babies are the quintessential kittens who have lots of love to give. They would do well with other young cats, however older cats may not be fans of their hijinks and energy. Since they are gentle and quite hardy, they would do well with conscientious children. They may not do well with dogs.**** Pick the (cafe) option for pick up!****","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/7f467d_b98939ba15014387b2bf4cf7e3b2865b~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_551,h_440,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/Image-empty-state.jpg",https://bbawcfosterteam.wixsite.com/cats/avaliblecats/mcchicken-and-sausage-burrito,2023-03-20 18:05:03+00:00,True,True,True,True,True,True,True,row_added
wheezy-and-wonky,,,,,,,,Wheezy and Wonky,11 month-old siblings,Need a home by 3/25,"Wheezy: Wheezy is a curious and fearless little kitten. She loves toys (especially chewing on her plush avocado) and is very serious about chasing her mouse or jingling balls. Wheezy will run full speed ahead despite her light “wheezy” breath. She has been given a round of antibiotics which has significantly helped her sneezing and wheezing. Wheezy is the first to explore new rooms and spaces and does occasionally attempt to bolt out the front door (so always be aware).When Wheezy is sleepy, she is quick to fold into your arms and loudly purr. Wheezy also loves to nibble on her brother’s ear when she is feeling especially cuddly and comfortable.  She enjoys litterboxes that are neat and tidy with taller sides for privacy.  In the past, Wheezy has relieved herself in the bathtub. However, when that is not an option (bathroom door closed), she eventually finds her way to the litterbox. Wheezy may be a tiny kitten, but she is mighty and makes her presence known. You cannot help but be enamored by Wheezy’s adorable face and feisty spirit. Wonky: Wonky may be the cuddliest kitten in the world. He must jump in your lap or be held whenever you get home from work/an outside activity. When Wonky is held, he immediately starts to suck his thumb and purr loudly. Just like a baby, sucking his thumb puts him right to sleep. He prefers to sleep on his human’s lap, chest, or neck. Whenever Wonky is not cuddling, he is eating or zooming through the apartment.Wonky is very social and loves to eat dry food when his humans are eating meals. His meals give him super cat speed, and he zooms through the apartment like a torpedo. Wonky enjoys chasing string toys and showing off his hunting/stalking instincts. Wonky will let you know when he needs attention with the sweetest “mew” and enjoys following his human wherever they may go. You cannot help but be smitten with this kitten’s loving and social personality. **** Pick the (cafe) option for pick up!****","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/7f467d_9125f655bd9c47cf9e8534f05028c268~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_551,h_440,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/Image-empty-state.png",https://bbawcfosterteam.wixsite.com/cats/avaliblecats/wheezy-and-wonky,2023-03-20 18:05:03+00:00,True,True,True,True,True,True,True,row_added
