This boy also loves to chill and will hang out on the couch or bed and just vibe while his humans watch TV. Brillo adores any feather wand toy and loves swatting and grabbing toys that he can bite. He’s also keen on running around the apartment swatting and chasing toys. He’s a sweet, silly cow with a big personality who loves to eat! Brillo is totally fine around other cats and strangers. Adopt this sweet friend for a wonderful addition to the family!!!!Please note that he is on some meds to support his liver function.

From her rescuer: Olive is a very affectionate girl, estimated by the vet to be around 5.5 to 6 months old. Olive is cat who really enjoys human company and to stay in arms and laps. She is still adjusting to engage with toys demonstrating to be very interested in feathered wands. Olive was rescued by a caseworker who knew she was left behind by her family. For 9 days, Olive stayed alone, in the apt, without any source of food and water. She is a little underweight but eating like a champ and with tons of love to give to whoever is willing to receive it. No signs of any type of aggression in her tiny body.Understandably, Olive doesn’t like to be alone for a long time and can become vocal if she needs attention. We bet she'd love a cat or dog friend!She is litter trained and got fully vetted after her rescue. Olive’s former family had two very young children; witnesses stated that Olive was excellent with them.

tully,,,,,,,,Tully,3ish year-old tabby male,"Ready now, rescuer can meet you at the cafe","From his rescuer: Tully arrived in my yard in early Summer 2021.  He was full of scrappy young cat vibes, bold, and ready for a fight…and then he had one (with a raccoon!) and ended up with a bad leg bite! Luckily I had a neuter appt for him and we treated the leg, put him in a kennel to recover and he trashed the place like a proper rock star.  When he returned to my yard, he scared away all the females in the colony and had various escapades such as bringing me baby possums as gifts, getting stuck in a tree, and thinking of my raised bed as a giant litter box (who can blame him).  However, over the year and a half he’s been with me he’s softened. He’d weave in and out of my legs but was not pettable. He’d still give me the occasional hiss, wasn’t touchable (except a little while eating), and swatted when feeling threatened. He is food motivated and endlessly curious so we got him a treat ball to keep him busy while we gardened. He liked to think of my yard as his and he basically never left. He’d come to my window nightly and meow for attention (and to visit one of my cats).  Fast forward to one morning in December 2022 - I whistled to call Tully to breakfast and he came with a chattering drooling jaw and kept pawing at his mouth. We thought he’d been poisoned! I got him in a carrier and to the ER and they discovered he’d broken a tooth off to the gum line and has pretty bad dental disease. Poor guy was in terrible pain and likely had been for some time (I’d be cranky too with a mouth like that). Fortunately, through a series of amazing, helpful, and passionate rescue friends, I brought him inside and his dental work will be done soon. While he’s been in his kennel he’s changed a lot.  His energy, while still sometimes guarded, has become more friendly - he’s purring, kneading, and eating off of people’s fingers and I even taught him to sit! He deserves a chance to become a house cat. He can still get startled and swat, but he is a totally different cat.    He is absolutely unable to have another cat in the house - he gets very stressed. The holding space with cats in and out has been challenging for him. ** Select Foster Pick Up (Intake) when scheduling****","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/7f467d_a389bffa67804090a4b8726e9ac048d6~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_551,h_440,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/Image-empty-state.jpg",https://bbawcfosterteam.wixsite.com/cats/avaliblecats/tully,2023-03-11 18:27:10+00:00,True,True,True,True,True,True,True,row_added

buffy,,,,,,,,Buffy,2ish year old white and tabby lady,"Ready now, fosterer can meet you at the cafe","Buffy was found in a basement along with her 3 kittens, Willow, Xander and Oz. They were hungry, dirty, and covered in fleas, yet not scared of us. Apparently Buffy was once owned and then left behind, which would explain how social she is. She is extremely friendly and happy to have been rescued. She walked into the carrier without a problem.She's been doing great in foster - lots of energy and adores playing! She even plays fetch. From her foster: Buffy is a friendly tabby who enjoys exploring as well as taking long naps. She loves playing with toys, particularly wands and anything else with a string. She is comfortable with being picked up, but doesn’t like being held too long. She likes to roam around the home exploring every corner and climbing onto high places (think top of the refrigerator). Buffy is fond of treats, all shapes and sizes, as well as eating her meals on time and she’ll let you know if she’s hungry with some chirps. She seems pretty active and will likely do well in a home where she can get plenty of attention and may enjoy having a feline friend. She would most likely do best in a home without children as she can still be a bit skittish and nip when scared, but she is making great progress and is a total delight.Please note, Buffy has a lot of energy and can play rough!

stuart-and-thumbs-up,Stuart and Thumbs Up,6 month-old BFFs,Need a home by 3/11,"These two purr-machines are the sweetest guys you’ll ever meet. Although they were hesitant about each other at first, they are now inseparable. They are always seen snuggled up to each other in the kitty bed grooming each other. Stuart is a very brave man. As soon as you get near him, he purrs so loudly and rubs up against you for snuggles. He is a total lover. He always wants to play and hop up on laps. Thumbs Up is a little bit more cautious at first than his BFF – while the first to explore, he is a bit more nervous about pets and snuggles and is quick to run and hide. However, every day, he comes out of his shell a bit more, becoming more vocal and purring as soon as he is pet.Both of these little guys are VERY hungry, love playing with toy mice, and exploring the apartment.

tully,Tully,3ish year-old tabby male,"Ready now, rescuer can meet you at the cafe","From his rescuer: Tully arrived in my yard in early Summer 2021.  He was full of scrappy young cat vibes, bold, and ready for a fight…and then he had one (with a raccoon!) and ended up with a bad leg bite! Luckily I had a neuter appt for him and we treated the leg, put him in a kennel to recover and he trashed the place like a proper rock star.  When he returned to my yard, he scared away all the females in the colony and had various escapades such as bringing me baby possums as gifts, getting stuck in a tree, and thinking of my raised bed as a giant litter box (who can blame him).  However, over the year and a half he’s been with me he’s softened. He’d weave in and out of my legs but was not pettable. He’d still give me the occasional hiss, wasn’t touchable (except a little while eating), and swatted when feeling threatened. He is food motivated and endlessly curious so we got him a treat ball to keep him busy while we gardened. He liked to think of my yard as his and he basically never left. He’d come to my window nightly and meow for attention (and to visit one of my cats).  Fast forward to one morning in December 2022 - I whistled to call Tully to breakfast and he came with a chattering drooling jaw and kept pawing at his mouth. We thought he’d been poisoned! I got him in a carrier and to the ER and they discovered he’d broken a tooth off to the gum line and has pretty bad dental disease. Poor guy was in terrible pain and likely had been for some time (I’d be cranky too with a mouth like that). Fortunately, through a series of amazing, helpful, and passionate rescue friends, I brought him inside and his dental work will be done soon. While he’s been in his kennel he’s changed a lot.  His energy, while still sometimes guarded, has become more friendly - he’s purring, kneading, and eating off of people’s fingers and I even taught him to sit! He deserves a chance to become a house cat. He can still get startled and swat, but he is a totally different cat.    He is absolutely unable to have another cat in the house - he gets very stressed. The holding space with cats in and out has been challenging for him. ** Select Foster Pick Up (Intake) when scheduling****","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/7f467d_a389bffa67804090a4b8726e9ac048d6~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_551,h_440,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/Image-empty-state.jpg",https://bbawcfosterteam.wixsite.com/cats/avaliblecats/tully,2023-03-17 23:38:25+00:00,Tully (reserved),3ish year-old tabby male,"Ready now, rescuer can meet you at the cafe","From his rescuer: Tully arrived in my yard in early Summer 2021.

As soon as you get near him, he purrs so loudly and rubs up against you for snuggles. He is a total lover. He always wants to play and hop up on laps. Thumbs Up is a little bit more cautious at first than his BFF – while the first to explore, he is a bit more nervous about pets and snuggles and is quick to run and hide. However, every day, he comes out of his shell a bit more, becoming more vocal and purring as soon as he is pet.Both of these little guys are VERY hungry, love playing with toy mice, and exploring the apartment. They don’t mind being picked up but don’t seem like they love to be held for that long. They get along great with the resident cat at their foster home, and it seems that they would do well with animals and children.

tully,Tully (reserved),3ish year-old tabby male,"Ready now, rescuer can meet you at the cafe","From his rescuer: Tully arrived in my yard in early Summer 2021.  He was full of scrappy young cat vibes, bold, and ready for a fight…and then he had one (with a raccoon!) and ended up with a bad leg bite! Luckily I had a neuter appt for him and we treated the leg, put him in a kennel to recover and he trashed the place like a proper rock star.  When he returned to my yard, he scared away all the females in the colony and had various escapades such as bringing me baby possums as gifts, getting stuck in a tree, and thinking of my raised bed as a giant litter box (who can blame him).  However, over the year and a half he’s been with me he’s softened. He’d weave in and out of my legs but was not pettable. He’d still give me the occasional hiss, wasn’t touchable (except a little while eating), and swatted when feeling threatened. He is food motivated and endlessly curious so we got him a treat ball to keep him busy while we gardened. He liked to think of my yard as his and he basically never left. He’d come to my window nightly and meow for attention (and to visit one of my cats).  Fast forward to one morning in December 2022 - I whistled to call Tully to breakfast and he came with a chattering drooling jaw and kept pawing at his mouth. We thought he’d been poisoned! I got him in a carrier and to the ER and they discovered he’d broken a tooth off to the gum line and has pretty bad dental disease. Poor guy was in terrible pain and likely had been for some time (I’d be cranky too with a mouth like that). Fortunately, through a series of amazing, helpful, and passionate rescue friends, I brought him inside and his dental work will be done soon. While he’s been in his kennel he’s changed a lot.  His energy, while still sometimes guarded, has become more friendly - he’s purring, kneading, and eating off of people’s fingers and I even taught him to sit! He deserves a chance to become a house cat. He can still get startled and swat, but he is a totally different cat.    He is absolutely unable to have another cat in the house - he gets very stressed. The holding space with cats in and out has been challenging for him. ** Select Foster Pick Up (Intake) when scheduling****","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/7f467d_a389bffa67804090a4b8726e9ac048d6~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_551,h_440,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/Image-empty-state.jpg",https://bbawcfosterteam.wixsite.com/cats/avaliblecats/tully-(reserved),2023-03-21 13:05:02+00:00,,,,,,,,True,True,True,True,True,True,True,row_deleted

wheezy-and-wonky,Wheezy and Wonky (reserved),11 month-old siblings,Need a home by 3/25,"Wheezy: Wheezy is a curious and fearless little kitten. She loves toys (especially chewing on her plush avocado) and is very serious about chasing her mouse or jingling balls. Wheezy will run full speed ahead despite her light “wheezy” breath. She has been given a round of antibiotics which has significantly helped her sneezing and wheezing. Wheezy is the first to explore new rooms and spaces and does occasionally attempt to bolt out the front door (so always be aware).When Wheezy is sleepy, she is quick to fold into your arms and loudly purr. Wheezy also loves to nibble on her brother’s ear when she is feeling especially cuddly and comfortable.  She enjoys litterboxes that are neat and tidy with taller sides for privacy.  In the past, Wheezy has relieved herself in the bathtub. However, when that is not an option (bathroom door closed), she eventually finds her way to the litterbox. Wheezy may be a tiny kitten, but she is mighty and makes her presence known. You cannot help but be enamored by Wheezy’s adorable face and feisty spirit. Wonky: Wonky may be the cuddliest kitten in the world. He must jump in your lap or be held whenever you get home from work/an outside activity. When Wonky is held, he immediately starts to suck his thumb and purr loudly. Just like a baby, sucking his thumb puts him right to sleep. He prefers to sleep on his human’s lap, chest, or neck. Whenever Wonky is not cuddling, he is eating or zooming through the apartment.Wonky is very social and loves to eat dry food when his humans are eating meals. His meals give him super cat speed, and he zooms through the apartment like a torpedo. Wonky enjoys chasing string toys and showing off his hunting/stalking instincts. Wonky will let you know when he needs attention with the sweetest “mew” and enjoys following his human wherever they may go.

mcchicken-and-sausage-burrito,McChicken and Sausage Burrito (reserved),7 month-old siblinbs,Need a home by 5/25,"The McDonalds kittens had a rough start, battling ringworm, an eye infection, and an ear infection. They spent several of their early months in a crate. But they have completely healed (except for some minor scarring in their eye) and they have discovered the joys of life outside of a crate. McChicken (tabby) and Sausage Burrito (gray) are a really special pair. They are extraordinarily cuddly and friendly. They love cuddles, kisses, and pets. And boy, do they love to play!Sausage Burrito is the runt of the litter, but don’t let her size fool you. She can wrestle with the best of them and could race a greyhound. She is quite petite, lean, and athletic. She loves scritches on her tiny head and pets and cuddling.McChicken is extremely, extremely cuddly. He has a bit of scarring on his eyes due to early eye infections. But he doesn’t let anything stand in his way! If he were a person, I’m sure that he would be quite the adventurer. Skydiving off cliffs and climbing Mt. Everest. His joy and zest for life is infectious. His fur is very soft and he is quite loyal to both cats and humans.These babies are the quintessential kittens who have lots of love to give. They would do well with other young cats, however older cats may not be fans of their hijinks and energy. Since they are gentle and quite hardy, they would do well with conscientious children. They may not do well with dogs.**** Pick the (cafe) option for pick up!****","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/7f467d_b98939ba15014387b2bf4cf7e3b2865b~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_551,h_440,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/Image-empty-state.jpg",https://bbawcfosterteam.wixsite.com/cats/avaliblecats/mcchicken-and-sausage-burrito-(reserved),2023-03-23 01:07:08+00:00,,,,,,,,True,True,True,True,True,True,True,row_deleted

She was rescued from a backyard in Brooklyn and her former temporarybed was lined with newspapers, the front page of which had an article about Spencer Dinwiddiefrom the Brooklyn Nets in all caps. She happened to be sitting on the ‘din’ when it was decidedwe needed to name her. Widdie has stuck ever since. She loves people, is very trusting, andmore wonover by attention than food. Her appetite from curiosity is also very present in herpersonality, a character who wants to know and learn. She loves to cuddle and be pet in yourlap. She loves to hunt a feather toy, or any toy for that matter. Her favorite spaces are in ornear windows and don’t forget to acknowledge her everytime you see her - its her favorite thing!Beau loves to be around people and will be all in with a lounge or a chill session. He is also food obsessed, you can really excite him with treats or a can of food! We think this is why he has a scruffy nose because when he was found outdoors he was always too hungry to realize he would push his whole face in the bowl! His favorite toy is a dancing string but he’s known to play-attack his own tail and roll around happily.  If he’s not entertaining himself, he’s usually lounging about waiting for the next mealtime.

They spent several of their early months in a crate. But they have completely healed (except for some minor scarring in their eye) and they have discovered the joys of life outside of a crate. Small Fries (orange tabby) is no longer small. He has become quite the cuddlebug! He makes a great sleeping companion and quite enjoys pets. He has a moderate level of energy, so he’s neither bouncing off the walls or a total cat bed potato. The perfect level of kitten playfulness and zen. Cheeseburger could definitely be a kitty model. She is a dilute tabby with faint shades of orange, including a slice of cheddar cheese on her forehead. She enjoys pets before dinnertime and laying around like she owns the place.These shyer kittens would do well in a quiet household, perhaps with very friendly cats.

sipha,Sipha (reserved),2 year-old black lady cat,Needs a home by 3/28,"Sipha is a mostly black cat with a few splashes of white. She’s a very small cat but packs a whole lot of sweetness into a tiny package. She loves nothing more than to be petted, and bonus points if she’s sitting in your lap while you do it. She’ll purr non-stop, offer you her chin, and give you loving head-butts. Her purrs are usually the loudest sounds you’ll hear from her. On the rare occasions that she does meow, they are the sweetest, quietest little vocalizations ever.Sipha was likely someone’s pet at some point, but has been living on the streets for a while. She was being fed by a kind person and has had at least two litters. As a result, while she adores humans, she’s a wary cat and frightens easily at loud noises and sudden movements. Don’t worry about her disappearing under the bed for too long, however. Just offer her cuddles and she’ll come right back out.Sipha is a very chill cat (not a whole lot of zoomies to deal with) and would do better as your one-and-only pet in a household free of children.","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/7f467d_c71267d2939d481495c0dd724b1e9180~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_551,h_440,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/Image-empty-state.jpg",https://bbawcfosterteam.wixsite.com/cats/avaliblecats/sipha-(reserved),2023-03-25 21:50:03+00:00,,,,,,,,True,True,True,True,True,True,True,row_deleted

bella-and-clara,,,,,,,,Bella and Clara (reserved),9 month-old bonded sisters,Need a new foster by 4/2,"From their fosterer: Bella and Clara are the sweetest bonded sisters. They are about 6 months old and were rescued off the streets. They’ve come so far since they were rescued and show every day how much they love being indoor kitties. These sisters love curling up together on a sunny couch or in their bed. They also love playing with wand toys, wrestling down the hall and exploring every inch of the apartment. Bella is a purr machine and adored attention. She can’t get enough morning pets, night time snuggles and really any opportunity to hang. Clara’s love language is quieter, but once you swaddle her in a blanket or towel, know she’s in her happy place. She lives for some behind the ear scratches. Together they are quite a special pair.Bella and Clara let us clip their nails with no problems and aren’t into scratching surfaces other than their scratch pads. After their time on the street, they really don’t like outside noise, so a quiet home is important for them. Two low-maintenance kitties with so much love to give!","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/7f467d_7d8cb1a0b9bb4900bdb5ededc83e112a~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_551,h_440,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/Image-empty-state.png",https://bbawcfosterteam.wixsite.com/cats/avaliblecats/bella-and-clara-(reserved),2023-03-26 14:25:59+00:00,True,True,True,True,True,True,True,row_added

He also has a sweet little tuft of white on his chest.

He also enjoys his daily churu, which most days he feels brave enough to eat from hand.He is a very chill boy who happily snoozes the day away with his little legs sprawled out of hisfavorite cat box.

bandito,,,,,,,,Bandito,2 year-old black and white male,"Ready starting 4/3, at the cafe","From his rescuer: Bandito was found in Bensonhurst Brooklyn wandering around the block where neighbors believed he belonged to a local Deli. Nobody knows where Bandito came from but he stayed in the area, surviving by eating from trash cans and sheltering in porches during wintertime. Nobody paid him attention until a foreigner from SI decided to rescue him and bring him back to health until his rightful owner claimed him… but Bandito waited in vain. Nobody responded to the flyers the good Samaritan posted about Bandito by street poles, asking around in the local businesses where Bandito was found, nor at the lost and found online pages.Bandito is a love bug. He loves to be pet, to be paid attention and won’t stop moving around showering his humans how much love he can give. He loves to give headbutts, offer his belly to be rubbed, and even do air biscuits purring loudly when content. Bandito seems to be very picky with his food but he just eats when he is hungry. He can also be vocal, especially if he wants attention to continue with the pet session or to let his humans know when he needs to eat ☺. Bandito is also very independent and playful. He loves the plastic springs, rattle mice toys, he will play alone chasing his ‘preys’ until he is out of breath. Bandito is also a pacifist. He will never bother or respond to any provocations from other cats to engage in a ‘quarrel’. Bandito can easily be picked up in arms and be transported anywhere, he is just not a cat to stay in arms to cuddle for long periods of time.

They are about 6 months old and were rescued off the streets. They’ve come so far since they were rescued and show every day how much they love being indoor kitties. These sisters love curling up together on a sunny couch or in their bed. They also love playing with wand toys, wrestling down the hall and exploring every inch of the apartment. Bella is a purr machine and adored attention. She can’t get enough morning pets, night time snuggles and really any opportunity to hang. Clara’s love language is quieter, but once you swaddle her in a blanket or towel, know she’s in her happy place. She lives for some behind the ear scratches. Together they are quite a special pair.Bella and Clara let us clip their nails with no problems and aren’t into scratching surfaces other than their scratch pads. After their time on the street, they really don’t like outside noise, so a quiet home is important for them.

They were hungry, dirty, and covered in fleas, yet not scared of us. Apparently Buffy was once owned and then left behind, which would explain how social she is. She is extremely friendly and happy to have been rescued. She walked into the carrier without a problem.She's been doing well in foster - lots of energy and adores playing! She even plays fetch. From her foster: Buffy is a friendly tabby who enjoys exploring as well as taking long naps. She loves playing with toys, particularly wands and anything else with a string. She is comfortable with being picked up, but doesn’t like being held too long. She likes to roam around the home exploring every corner and climbing onto high places (think top of the refrigerator). Buffy is fond of treats, all shapes and sizes, as well as eating her meals on time and she’ll let you know if she’s hungry with some chirps.

sparkles,Sparkles,6 year-old all black male cat,Needs a new foster by 4/5,"Sparkle is still in his shy boy era but is slowly making progress, learning to trust people andenjoy his new life indoors and off the streets where he was not living his best, well deservedSparkle life.He has the most gorgeous green eyes and little flecks of white throughout his otherwise allblack silky coat. He also has a sweet little tuft of white on his chest. His left eye is a little cloudyfrom a previous injury and will remain so, but he isn’t in any pain - it just adds to his cute factor.He still prefers to dine alone but is not picky and will eat up any food or treats he gets in recordtime. He also enjoys his daily churu, which most days he feels brave enough to eat from hand.He is a very chill boy who happily snoozes the day away with his little legs sprawled out of hisfavorite cat box. He is starting to tolerate pets on the head and despite being weary I think hewill soon realize that he actually does enjoy them alot. He gives himself away by the way hiseyes close and he can’t help but lean into the love. Recently he has begun to play with toys andit is so very sweet to witness him being a regular ol’ playful cat.On a few occasions when surprised or taken off guard he has hissed to show his fear. His newfamily will need to be slow and steady with him and continue to show him how safe he is now. Ihave no doubt that the sweetest most laid back cat is inside just waiting to feel comfortable andconfident enough to fully show his true self. When he learns to fully trust, whoever gets thepleasure of being his new family will get the best reward of seeing this sweet boy learn whatlove is.","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/7f467d_1216e149a53e4836981f273063859bf2~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_551,h_440,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/Image-empty-state.jpg",https://bbawcfosterteam.wixsite.com/cats/avaliblecats/sparkles,2023-04-04 12:30:03+00:00,,,,,,,,True,True,True,True,True,True,True,row_deleted

Nobody paid him attention until a foreigner from SI decided to rescue him and bring him back to health until his rightful owner claimed him… but Bandito waited in vain. Nobody responded to the flyers the good Samaritan posted about Bandito by street poles, asking around in the local businesses where Bandito was found, nor at the lost and found online pages.Bandito is a love bug. He loves to be pet, to be paid attention and won’t stop moving around showering his humans how much love he can give. He loves to give headbutts, offer his belly to be rubbed, and even do air biscuits purring loudly when content. Bandito seems to be very picky with his food but he just eats when he is hungry. He can also be vocal, especially if he wants attention to continue with the pet session or to let his humans know when he needs to eat ☺. Bandito is also very independent and playful. He loves the plastic springs, rattle mice toys, he will play alone chasing his ‘preys’ until he is out of breath. Bandito is also a pacifist. He will never bother or respond to any provocations from other cats to engage in a ‘quarrel’.

He loves to give headbutts, offer his belly to be rubbed, and even do air biscuits purring loudly when content. Bandito seems to be very picky with his food but he just eats when he is hungry. He can also be vocal, especially if he wants attention to continue with the pet session or to let his humans know when he needs to eat ☺. Bandito is also very independent and playful. He loves the plastic springs, rattle mice toys, he will play alone chasing his ‘preys’ until he is out of breath. Bandito is also a pacifist. He will never bother or respond to any provocations from other cats to engage in a ‘quarrel’. Bandito can easily be picked up in arms and be transported anywhere, he is just not a cat to stay in arms to cuddle for long periods of time.

Nobody knows where Bandito came from but he stayed in the area, surviving by eating from trash cans and sheltering in porches during wintertime. Nobody paid him attention until a foreigner from SI decided to rescue him and bring him back to health until his rightful owner claimed him… but Bandito waited in vain.

buffy,Buffy,"Buffy was found in a basement along with her 3 kittens, Willow, Xander and Oz. They were hungry, dirty, and covered in fleas, yet not scared of us. Apparently Buffy was once owned and then left behind, which would explain how social she is. She is extremely friendly and happy to have been rescued. She walked into the carrier without a problem.She's been doing well in foster - lots of energy and adores playing! She even plays fetch. From her foster: Buffy is a friendly tabby who enjoys exploring as well as taking long naps. She loves playing with toys, particularly wands and anything else with a string. She is comfortable with being picked up, but doesn’t like being held too long. She likes to roam around the home exploring every corner and climbing onto high places (think top of the refrigerator). Buffy is fond of treats, all shapes and sizes, as well as eating her meals on time and she’ll let you know if she’s hungry with some chirps. She seems pretty active and will likely do well in a home where she can get plenty of attention and may enjoy having a feline friend. She would most likely do best in a home without children as she can still be a bit skittish and nip when scared, but she is making great progress and is a total delight.Please note, Buffy has a lot of energy and can play rough! We'll help you prepare a plan to keep her occupied and on the right track but she'll need some dedication.** Select Foster Pick Up (cafe) when scheduling****","Buffy was found in a basement along with her 3 kittens, Willow, Xander and Oz.

hurricane-and-tsunami,,,,,,,,Hurricane and Tsunami,6 month-old siblings,"Ready now, fosterer can meet you at the cafe","Hurricane is a super brave and incredibly affectionate little boy. He loves to run around and attack anything left on the floor when he has the zoomies, but will extra appreciate it if you play fetch with him! Just like a dog, he will retrieve his mouse toy when it’s thrown. He adores people and his big foster brother, and will follow both of them around, sometimes getting a bit under foot in his quest for attention. He’s constantly trying to cuddle up to you and purr for pets, and when it’s time to sleep there’s nothing he enjoys more than a warm lap. Once he gets settled in, he’s basically a ragdoll; you can even trim his nails without him batting an eye.Tsunami is shyer than her brother, but her trust is easy to earn with treats and playtime sessions. She loves to chase a feather on a stick and play hide and pounce with Hurricane. She’s not quite a lap cat but once she gets to know you she will happily accept pets at nap time, often flopping over to purr when she finally lets her guard down and remembers she loves to be pampered. Because of her white face and pink lips she looks like she’s got a permanent blep, which is just adorable.This tuxedo duo are great if you want a lot of interaction or to just watch them chase each other around, and listen to them chirp and purr. After giving each other grooming sessions they often fall asleep embracing like an adorable yin yang. Just watch your feet at night because anything moving under a blanket might get pounced on! They get along very well with their older foster brother, so should have no problem acclimating to other household pets.","data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///wAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==",https://bbawcfosterteam.wixsite.com/cats/avaliblecats/hurricane-and-tsunami,2023-04-17 12:26:01+00:00,True,True,True,True,True,True,True,row_added

bandito,Bandito (reserved),2 year-old black and white male,"Ready now, at the cafe","From his rescuer: Bandito was found in Bensonhurst Brooklyn wandering around the block where neighbors believed he belonged to a local Deli. Nobody knows where Bandito came from but he stayed in the area, surviving by eating from trash cans and sheltering in porches during wintertime. Nobody paid him attention until a foreigner from SI decided to rescue him and bring him back to health until his rightful owner claimed him… but Bandito waited in vain. Nobody responded to the flyers the good Samaritan posted about Bandito by street poles, asking around in the local businesses where Bandito was found, nor at the lost and found online pages.Bandito is a love bug. He loves to be pet, to be paid attention and won’t stop moving around showering his humans how much love he can give. He loves to give headbutts, offer his belly to be rubbed, and even do air biscuits purring loudly when content. Bandito seems to be very picky with his food but he just eats when he is hungry. He can also be vocal, especially if he wants attention to continue with the pet session or to let his humans know when he needs to eat ☺. Bandito is also very independent and playful. He loves the plastic springs, rattle mice toys, he will play alone chasing his ‘preys’ until he is out of breath. Bandito is also a pacifist. He will never bother or respond to any provocations from other cats to engage in a ‘quarrel’. Bandito can easily be picked up in arms and be transported anywhere, he is just not a cat to stay in arms to cuddle for long periods of time. He seems to be a half lap kitty as he likes to sit and spend time with his human with half his body on the lap.Please pick (cafe) pick up option!","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/7f467d_02aa86f517a141c39eeb36d44fc387f6~mv2.jpeg/v1/fill/w_551,h_440,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/Image-empty-state.jpeg",https://bbawcfosterteam.wixsite.com/cats/avaliblecats/bandito-(reserved),2023-04-19 02:30:17+00:00,,,,,,,,True,True,True,True,True,True,True,row_deleted

dipsy-and-tinky-winky,,,,,,,,Dipsy and Tinky Winky,1 year-old brother and sister,Need a home by May 5th,"From their current fosterer: These one-year-old playful balls of energy will have you laughing at their antics and will definitely make their presence felt in your home. They love to play, whether it’s chasing each other madly around during their morning and evening zoomies, or pouncing on each other during their daily wrestling matches. Like all young cats, they are fond of toys, boxes, and any small object they can bat around and play with. They enjoy spending time looking out the window, surveilling everything happening outside. (Watch out plants, they might like to use you as toys too!)Dipsy (black and white boy) is the braver, more inquisitive and more confident of the pair.. He loves snuggles, whether it’s being your big or little spoon, and regularly seeks out affection during the day. He trills to get your attention and frequently asks for pets. He’ll follow you from room to room, making sure you’re still there, and will often come when called.Tinky Winky (tabby girl) is the shyer of the pair and likes her space. She likes to interact on her own terms, and while not fond of pets, she does enjoy interacting with feet through the bed covers.They both love food and will come running as soon as they hear the crack of the food can or the rustle of the dry food bag. They’re wild about Churus - Dipsy, in particular, can sniff out a freshly opened packed from the other side of the apartment and will rush to get some into his belly immediately! Tinky Winky loves Churus too, although is more reserved about asking for it.These sweet young cats would do well with a single adopter or a work from home couple, who will give them the time and patience they need to feel comfortable around new people and the confidence to open up in their own way.","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/7f467d_172204c92d7f49ef9820d070a785dd6a~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_551,h_440,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/Image-empty-state.jpg",https://bbawcfosterteam.wixsite.com/cats/avaliblecats/dipsy-and-tinky-winky,2023-04-21 13:00:05+00:00,True,True,True,True,True,True,True,row_added

Norma is a quiet, shy girl who is already showing curiosity in the cats and world outside her pen. She is a bit nervous still but doesn’t act out when you pet her. She will get upset (for now) when you pick her up, so we simply put a carrier in front of her if we need to go somewhere and she trots right in. Norma will need time as she learns to trust again.please pick (intake) option when scheduling","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/7f467d_e027bdd63a954c35b3b0883953a6bd7c~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_551,h_440,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/Image-empty-state.jpg",https://bbawcfosterteam.wixsite.com/cats/avaliblecats/huck-and-norma-(reserved),2023-04-23 03:59:21+00:00,True,False,False,False,False,True,True,row_modified
hurricane-and-tsunami,Hurricane and Tsunami (reserved),6 month-old siblings,"Ready now, fosterer can meet you at the cafe","Hurricane is a super brave and incredibly affectionate little boy. He loves to run around and attack anything left on the floor when he has the zoomies, but will extra appreciate it if you play fetch with him! Just like a dog, he will retrieve his mouse toy when it’s thrown. He adores people and his big foster brother, and will follow both of them around, sometimes getting a bit under foot in his quest for attention. He’s constantly trying to cuddle up to you and purr for pets, and when it’s time to sleep there’s nothing he enjoys more than a warm lap. Once he gets settled in, he’s basically a ragdoll; you can even trim his nails without him batting an eye.Tsunami is shyer than her brother, but her trust is easy to earn with treats and playtime sessions. She loves to chase a feather on a stick and play hide and pounce with Hurricane. She’s not quite a lap cat but once she gets to know you she will happily accept pets at nap time, often flopping over to purr when she finally lets her guard down and remembers she loves to be pampered. Because of her white face and pink lips she looks like she’s got a permanent blep, which is just adorable.This tuxedo duo are great if you want a lot of interaction or to just watch them chase each other around, and listen to them chirp and purr. After giving each other grooming sessions they often fall asleep embracing like an adorable yin yang. Just watch your feet at night because anything moving under a blanket might get pounced on! They get along very well with their older foster brother, so should have no problem acclimating to other household pets.","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/7f467d_d3ac7f3289ff4c538f89d66752711084~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_551,h_440,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/Image-empty-state.jpg",https://bbawcfosterteam.wixsite.com/cats/avaliblecats/hurricane-and-tsunami-(reserved),2023-04-23 00:46:09+00:00,,,,,,,,True,True,True,True,True,True,True,row_deleted

These bonded siblings were left alone in a Bronx apartment when their family moved out at the end of March 2023.  They are about 2 years old, shy but super sweet and ready for their new chapter. Huck is an absolute doll! He comes to your hand and loves to be pet! His butt rises in the air when you pet it! Huck is already showing what a sweet loving wonderful pet he will be! Norma is a quiet, shy girl who is already showing curiosity in the cats and world outside her pen. She is a bit nervous still but doesn’t act out when you pet her. She will get upset (for now) when you pick her up, so we simply put a carrier in front of her if we need to go somewhere and she trots right in.

zeta-and-omega,,,,,,,,Zeta and Omega,1 year old siblings,"Ready now, can meet you at the cafe","From their person, who sadly has to surrender them due to allergies: Omega and Zeta are by far the cutest bonded pair ever. They are super playful, energetic, and so sweet. They respond to their names (Omega and Zeta), and they also love to cuddle. Omega and Zeta will play with anything they find on the floor, from a paper ball to anything that makes a crunching sound. They love to be petted and purr very loudly. They are super affectionate and get along well with others (humans and even some cats). They are indeed lap cats. If Omega and Zeta find you sitting, they will both try to sit on your lap. If they aren’t sitting on your lap, they are following you around the house and sitting near you. They are very independent cats, but they also love attention. They love gazing out the windows too. Fun fact about Zeta, he loves water and loves to play with it as well. They do not scratch or bite people, either. But they will give you little head rubs.Please pick an (intake) type appointment for pick up","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/7f467d_e118ee4fb1684a6fb4ef0686158831c3~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_551,h_440,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/Image-empty-state.jpg",https://bbawcfosterteam.wixsite.com/cats/avaliblecats/zeta-and-omega,2023-04-27 14:38:49+00:00,True,True,True,True,True,True,True,row_added
