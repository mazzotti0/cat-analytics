This boy also loves to chill and will hang out on the couch or bed and just vibe while his humans watch TV. Brillo adores any feather wand toy and loves swatting and grabbing toys that he can bite. He’s also keen on running around the apartment swatting and chasing toys. He’s a sweet, silly cow with a big personality who loves to eat! Brillo is totally fine around other cats and strangers. Adopt this sweet friend for a wonderful addition to the family!!!!Please note that he is on some meds to support his liver function.

From her rescuer: Olive is a very affectionate girl, estimated by the vet to be around 5.5 to 6 months old. Olive is cat who really enjoys human company and to stay in arms and laps. She is still adjusting to engage with toys demonstrating to be very interested in feathered wands. Olive was rescued by a caseworker who knew she was left behind by her family. For 9 days, Olive stayed alone, in the apt, without any source of food and water. She is a little underweight but eating like a champ and with tons of love to give to whoever is willing to receive it. No signs of any type of aggression in her tiny body.Understandably, Olive doesn’t like to be alone for a long time and can become vocal if she needs attention. We bet she'd love a cat or dog friend!She is litter trained and got fully vetted after her rescue. Olive’s former family had two very young children; witnesses stated that Olive was excellent with them.

tully,,,,,,,,Tully,3ish year-old tabby male,"Ready now, rescuer can meet you at the cafe","From his rescuer: Tully arrived in my yard in early Summer 2021.  He was full of scrappy young cat vibes, bold, and ready for a fight…and then he had one (with a raccoon!) and ended up with a bad leg bite! Luckily I had a neuter appt for him and we treated the leg, put him in a kennel to recover and he trashed the place like a proper rock star.  When he returned to my yard, he scared away all the females in the colony and had various escapades such as bringing me baby possums as gifts, getting stuck in a tree, and thinking of my raised bed as a giant litter box (who can blame him).  However, over the year and a half he’s been with me he’s softened. He’d weave in and out of my legs but was not pettable. He’d still give me the occasional hiss, wasn’t touchable (except a little while eating), and swatted when feeling threatened. He is food motivated and endlessly curious so we got him a treat ball to keep him busy while we gardened. He liked to think of my yard as his and he basically never left. He’d come to my window nightly and meow for attention (and to visit one of my cats).  Fast forward to one morning in December 2022 - I whistled to call Tully to breakfast and he came with a chattering drooling jaw and kept pawing at his mouth. We thought he’d been poisoned! I got him in a carrier and to the ER and they discovered he’d broken a tooth off to the gum line and has pretty bad dental disease. Poor guy was in terrible pain and likely had been for some time (I’d be cranky too with a mouth like that). Fortunately, through a series of amazing, helpful, and passionate rescue friends, I brought him inside and his dental work will be done soon. While he’s been in his kennel he’s changed a lot.  His energy, while still sometimes guarded, has become more friendly - he’s purring, kneading, and eating off of people’s fingers and I even taught him to sit! He deserves a chance to become a house cat. He can still get startled and swat, but he is a totally different cat.    He is absolutely unable to have another cat in the house - he gets very stressed. The holding space with cats in and out has been challenging for him. ** Select Foster Pick Up (Intake) when scheduling****","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/7f467d_a389bffa67804090a4b8726e9ac048d6~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_551,h_440,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/Image-empty-state.jpg",https://bbawcfosterteam.wixsite.com/cats/avaliblecats/tully,2023-03-11 18:27:10+00:00,True,True,True,True,True,True,True,row_added

onyx,Onyx (reserved),1 year-old all black male,"Ready now,  at the cafe","Onyx is a gentle giant (16lbs!) with beautiful eyes. He’s a little bit mysterious, a little shy and a little bossy. He purrs and nuzzles into your hand as soon as you pet him. Onyx wants to be loved so badly, but he gets scared when doors open and runs back to his safe space.

He doesn’t require a lot of attention, though he appreciates company and is happy to stare out the window. Onyx appears to have some food allergies!

Without it he gets itchy...","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/7f467d_e76150b2d6ee45f2a3bbe1b1682169ec~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_551,h_440,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/Image-empty-state.jpg",https://bbawcfosterteam.wixsite.com/cats/avaliblecats/onyx-(reserved),2023-03-12 21:05:02+00:00,,,,,,,,True,True,True,True,True,True,True,row_deleted
