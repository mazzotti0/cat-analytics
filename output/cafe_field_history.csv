18948728,description,"Popeye and Bluto are a beautiful bonded sibling pair. Popeye is a playful and friendly male in a dapper tuxedo. He is very friendly and playful and purrs instantly when you scratch his neck. Bluto is petite with a gorgeous tortoiseshell coat. She is still working on being as brave as her brother, but treats will quickly win her over and she is quick to purr when held. Bluto has come a long way and will definitely continue to come out of her shell with patience and snacks. This sweet pair would do best in a patient and quiet household without children.",2023-07-08 16:27:17+00:00,2023-07-08 17:09:22+00:00

17834315,description,"Bobsled is a kind and quirky tuxedo who loves to follow you around while headbutting your legs and purring. This social guy will hang with you as you work from home or cook in the evening. He enjoys pets on the chin, behind the ears and on his back and very much appreciates scritches near the tail. He is happy as a single cat, but also does very well with a companion.",2023-07-08 16:27:17+00:00,2023-07-08 17:09:22+00:00

18578528,description,"Mesclun and Butterhead are two active sisters who love to wrestle and zoom around the home. After play time, you can catch them snuggling up for a nap in the sun. Butterhead (black & white) will happily greet you at the door after a long day of work. She’ll then bribe you for scritches by stretching out on the floor and flashing her cutest poses. Butterhead can keep herself entertained for hours with a turntable ball toy and plush toys. Don’t mind if Butterhead joins you on a Netflix binge — she particularly enjoys watching football and nature documentaries. Mesclun is a bit more on the mellow side, but that doesn’t stop her sweet personality from shining. She is very curious, so she can typically be found in a box or paperbag that you have lying around. Her favorite activity is chasing a laser toy around the home and finding the best cuddle spots.",2023-07-08 16:27:17+00:00,

18844861,description,"Let’s get ready to rumble! Fennel (white and gray) and Stowaway (brown tabby) adore a good game of chase, tumbling and LOTS of wrestling. These semi-pro wrestlers play hard but love hard too - after wearing themselves out, they are eager for some pro snuggles and cuddles. Stowy likes to sit on laps and chests for lots of pets and will then settle down for a snooze on top of your propped up legs. She’ll make sure to make frequent trips back to your lap for more pets before snuggling back onto her favorite leg spot. Make sure you have a blanket or a throw when you are watching TV or reading a book because Fennel loves to crawl under a blanket and snuggle into your lap. Once he’s warmed up, he’ll crawl out from under the blanket and happily sit on your chest and reward you with lots of nose kisses while he gets his requested pets. Fennel’s other favorite spot is sitting behind you on the sofa so he can wrap himself around your neck and purr loudly into your ear.",2023-07-08 16:27:17+00:00,2023-07-08 17:09:22+00:00

He is super sweet and affectionate and likes to come say hello by rubbing your legs with his head. Jacques also LOVES being brushed and will sometimes flip over to give you his belly for some rubs. Jacques adores being close to his humans and will jump up to the chair next to your desk and watch you work or will quietly sit to watch you do chores around the house, patiently waiting for attention and pets. This smart boy has learned to be patient and will sit when you grab the treat bag and wait for you to give him the treat instead of reaching with his little cute paws. If you pat the seat next to you and ask him to come over, he will happily jump up onto the couch to sit next to you. Jacques is the most polite and gentle baby and you will fall in love with him immediately, just look at his sweet face!! Jacques has dental disease and in need of surgery -- we'd be happy to talk more about what this entails.",2023-07-08 16:27:17+00:00,2023-07-08 17:09:22+00:00

18848819,description,"Ready to fall in love? The two of them are an inseparable pair: their default state is to lie right next to, if not on top of, one another. They can usually be found in a cozy spot not far from where the humans are—on a chair, burrowed in a blanket, or right on your desk as you tap away at your keyboard! Jammies looks black at first, but in the sunlight you can see her beautiful brown stripes. She has developed the daily routine of greeting her humans every morning by meowing and promptly flopping over, soliciting belly rubs. When she isn’t basking in the sun or curling up for a nap, she will climb onto your lap for pets and make it hard for you to focus on your ask at hand. Nightie tends to follow her sister’s lead, but is confident enough to invite treats, pets, and under-the-chin scratches (her favorite kind) all by herself. Nightie is excited to show you her stretching abilities and her balancing skills, getting up on her two hind legs to grab a toy, chat with her sister, or push open the door if you closed it by accident!  Endless entertainment and affection await anyone who provides these sisters with a permanent home.",2023-07-08 16:27:17+00:00,2023-07-08 17:09:22+00:00

18844513,description,"Sweet like jam, Pam is a cute, quiet, cautious little babe. She spends her days loafing in various locations: beds and couches and closets, oh my! Once you can get close enough for a pet or a snuggle, she’s a sucker for a chin scratch. When the floodgates open, she’s a purr machine, prancing back and forth and rubbing nearby furniture to ask for more loves. She tends to play hard to get, and has been spotted playing with toys late at night when she thinks no one is watching. She has quite the squeaky meow (which feels appropriate), and will call to you at meal times and prance nearby till she is served. She is easily startled and has a strong aversion to the sound of running water (goofy) — but she is also a master of forgiveness and is easily tempted by all varieties of treats. Simply, Pam is a gentle soul. Her story began when she was found living with her sister wife partner outdoors tending to a family of kittens. When she was rescued and relieved of her motherly duties, Pam had a big sigh of relief. Pam is looking for a quiet, patient forever home where she can hit snooze, over, and over.

While she’s not yet at the snuggly phase, she’s very sociable and will march right up to you for some people time or take nibble a treat from your hand. She needs patient humans and a calm and quiet home where she can continue to blossom.

Although they can be a little skittish while settling into a new place, Broomstick and Candelabra will transform into rambunctious, snuggly little furbabies as soon as they’re comfortable. Candelabra has earned the nickname “Lawnmower” with his foster family due to how loudly he purrs. He’s also not afraid to speak up, and he will let you know with his squeaky little mew when it’s time to play or give him snuggles (which is often!). At night, once he’s gotten his zoomies out with his brother, he likes to settle in for some snuggles on his foster mom’s legs. Broomstick is a little more shy, but if you’re patient (and generous with Churus, his favorite treats) he’ll be happy to play and accept some pets from you. These boys absolutely adore one another, and it’s so fun to watch them play and snuggle, and so gratifying to be let in on the fun once you’ve earned their trust!",2023-07-08 16:27:17+00:00,2023-07-08 17:09:22+00:00

18995049,description,"Small Fries and Cheeseburger are the perfect combo. Small Fries (orange tabby) is no longer small. He has become quite the cuddlebug! He makes a great sleeping companion and quite enjoys pets. He has a moderate level of energy, so he’s neither bouncing off the walls or a total cat bed potato. The perfect level of kitten playfulness and zen. Cheeseburger could definitely be a kitty model. She is a dilute tabby with faint shades of orange, including a slice of cheddar cheese on her forehead. She enjoys pets before dinnertime and laying around like she owns the place. These kittens would do well in a quiet household and get along well with other cats.",2023-07-08 16:27:17+00:00,2023-07-08 17:09:22+00:00

19061860,description,"Maple and Cork are two absolutely adorable kittens with sweetness and goofiness to spare. It’s hard to snap photos of these speedy siblings because they’ve always got the zoomies! Their favorite things are climbing your legs like a tree, pouncing on cat toys with a vengeance, and purring angelically when their kitten energy finally runs out. Maple is a very handsome black cat with a big belly and gorgeous green eyes. When he’s not wrestling with his sister, he’s a sucker for scritches and being held like a baby. Cork is a very petite girl with the smallest, cutest kissable face. She loves playing hide and seek and finding new heights to climb around the apartment. Together they’re an unstoppable pair, and would bring so much love and laughter to their adoptive home.",2023-07-08 16:27:17+00:00,2023-07-08 17:09:22+00:00

Creamy loves to keep an eye on his humans and is a bit of a climber who will need some correction or restraint to keep him off the counters. He isn’t good at taking a hint but can easily be scooped up and put in another room. Creamy can get a powerful case of zoomies – he plays hard, leaping, backflipping, and dragging and defeathering his defeated “prey” toys. He takes long naps during the day and at night, but in the mornings and evenings he’s a friendly and very high-energy guy.",2023-07-08 16:27:17+00:00,2023-07-08 17:09:22+00:00

Always the first to initiate playtime with his siblings, he knows how to have a good time. He’s a brave and adventurous boy. With his silky black and white fur, crisp green eyes, and a long and languid frame, Dipsy looks ever at ease stretched out on a favorite chair in the sun. The braver of the pair, he is adventurous, easygoing, and eager to explore. Tinky Winky takes her time sizing things up, but is well worth the wait. This stunning girl never refuses a treat.

19014938,description,"This handsome, ginger boy, with magically floofy ears, is as energetic and curious as he is sweet. Dumont loves attention of any kind and seeks it out constantly - to the chagrin of his foster, sometimes a little too early in the morning. He is forgiven quickly when he begins to purr like a motorcycle or starts his entertaining antics - one second he's sitting in a loaf position, and in another his ears will charge up and he's running, attacking something imaginary (or sometimes a chair). This boy is enthusiastic about all things food and is not at all shy about letting you know how he feels so be prepared for his quick sprint when he gets an inkling that it is mealtime. Dumont is a joy to return home to - greeting you with headbutts and following you around in order to be close by, all the while singing his sweet signature purr. Because Dumont has FeLV, he can only be around other FeLV cats, but he is visibly healthy with no outward signs of FeLV. He will have the best chance at living many more years in a caring home with a proper diet.",2023-07-08 16:27:17+00:00,

He likes his own space and can nap for hours, so if you live a busy life, you won’t need to worry about keeping him entertained or out of trouble. When beckoned, though, he always comes out ready to play. If you’re looking for an affectionate, self-reliant, mature companion, Finn is the guy for you.

18967750,description,"Giblets is an ABSOLUTE goober and a total teenage kitten. He’s extremely playful, a connoisseur of catnip, and he loves nothing more than a jingle ball, a plastic curlicue, or, frankly, whatever you have lying around. He’ll fall off a chair, watch a bird for 10,000 hours, and can be stopped from going on the counter if you just make an interesting enough noise across the room. He isn't a lap cat unless he climbs up himself, but this little guy glues himself to your side, always wanting to be in the same room, the same piece of furniture, or the same couch spot as his person. He loves to be in the mix. He goes ape for head and chest scritches, and then loses it in a totally different way if you migrate down to attempt a tummy pet. Giblets would be happiest in a home with another young and playful cat.",2023-07-08 16:27:17+00:00,2023-07-08 17:09:22+00:00

19061560,description,"Negroni and Gino may not be related, but they definitely act like brothers. Negroni is the playful, excited little brother that's always following Gino around. When Gino goes to a room, Negroni follows after. If Gino is eating, Negroni stays close by and watches. Negroni loves to play with feather toys and chase springs back and forth all day. When they cuddle together on the couch or the bed, they take turns grooming each other and sometimes even fall asleep next to each other. Gino is the calm and sweet-natured big brother. He warms up to you almost immediately and will sit by you for pets and snuggles. He loves to be near you and will follow you wherever you go. Both cats really enjoy being around each other, and they bring out the best in one another. Negroni is less shy when Gino is around, and Gino is more relaxed when Negroni is nearby. They are both just so sweet! Editor's note: This is an epic cat love story. Trapped near each other, their rescuer assumed they were friends but not particularly attached to each other, just fans of other cats. When they were sent to separate foster homes Gino cried all night and Negroni retreated under a sink and hissed and swiped. As soon as they were reunited all of that fell away. They had just been pining!",2023-07-08 16:27:17+00:00,2023-07-08 17:09:22+00:00

He likes to pretend to only be interested in playtime, but he actually loves to be snuggled and pet, and rubbing his little face against your face. He is quick to reciprocate love with loud purrs and the most loving gaze and enjoys being carried around like a baby! Fivela is silly and active, usually scampering around ready to attack the next foot she sees. Even though playtime is her number one priority, Fivela can also appreciate a good head or chin scratch and and actively seeks out human company at all times. She’s got a surprisingly loud purr on her and is basically a one-cat biscuit factory!",2023-07-08 16:27:17+00:00,2023-07-08 17:09:22+00:00

19004866,description,"Hugo and Amicia are the perfect combination of orange and tortie kittens! They are playful and love wand toys and enjoys curling up in laps. Hugo is a handsome and happy kitten. He purrs as soon as you pick him up and will stay in your arms for hours if you let him. He enjoys being held, sitting on his human’s lap and grooming his humans. Hugo is a good work-from-home assistant (or distraction?) and will stay next to you to keep you company. Hugo enjoys napping on the bed with his foster so make sure you reserve a spot on the bed for him when it comes to the bed time. Amicia has the cutest face and her fur is silky soft. She is slightly reserved than Hugo but once you bring out her favorite treats, Churu, she will jump right into your lap. After finishing Churu, she would hang out on your lap and enjoy scritches. Amicia may have mild cerebellar hypoplasia which means she walks a little bit wobbly. However, this doesn’t stop her from jumping onto the couch and chasing her favorite toy. She can be uncoordinated at times but it doesn’t impact her daily life.",2023-07-08 16:27:17+00:00,2023-07-08 17:09:22+00:00

She previously lived on a porch where she gave birth to litter after litter of kittens. She was brought to us ill and with a large gnarly face wound to finally be spayed and begin the next chapter of her life. Both her demeanor and appearance still show traces of the trauma and difficult circumstances of her past street life, but she is making rapid progress and now feels secure enough to eat and nap (complete with adorable loud snores) in front of her foster mother. She may initially hiss at you, but that is just how she says hello! Scritches to the head, neck, and ears elicit rusty-sounding purrs; however, she also suddenly gets overstimulated and will gently bite or clasp your arm. She needs affection on her own terms and needs to be adopted into a home with experienced cat owners and no children. She is indifferent to other cats and would be happy as a single or as a companion to polite feline friends.",2023-07-08 16:27:17+00:00,2023-07-08 17:09:22+00:00

19060870,description,"Lucas is a gentle soul who loves to lounge in the window and watch cat TV. He was rescued with very hurt paws and we weren't sure at first if he was friendly, but as his health improved, so did his spirits and he was soon requesting scritches and attention. Lucas can still be a bit shy, but is quick to find confidence when offered a handful of treats. He is a very, very deep sleeper regardless of noise and/or chaos surrounding him (even vaccums). Lucas is looking for a quiet home either by himself or with a calm companion cat - no kids or dogs, please.",2023-07-08 16:27:17+00:00,2023-07-08 17:09:22+00:00

18842008,description,"Mack was discovered having a playful moment with some leaves on the sidewalk — and despite being cold and infested with fleas, he immediately greeted human hands with loud purrs and happy rubs. This silly boy loves to play and hates to be left alone. He enjoys nestling against laps, faces, and chins and will scale your chest to purr right in your ears. Full of spirited energy, he enjoys racing back and forth the length of the apartment, watching the outside world from the window, and chasing fuzzy strings. Mack needs an attentive home where he can get his fill of cuddles, snuggles and playtime. He needs to be adopted into a home with an age appropriate feline friend or we can pair him up with a buddy.",2023-07-08 16:27:17+00:00,2023-07-08 17:09:22+00:00

She’s not afraid of new people, and loves to be pet on her own terms. If you’re especially favored, expect to receive an extended grooming session — licking is her favorite way of showing affection! Marly’s happy to lay down in a corner with your company and just purr away. She loves to stretch out and sunbathe during the day and curl up at the foot of your bed at night. Sudden movements and noises still startle Marly so she may not be great with rowdy kids, but as long as you’re not stomping and chasing her around, she’s perfectly happy to laze around.",2023-07-08 16:27:17+00:00,2023-07-08 17:09:22+00:00

When he is feeling social, he is incredibly affectionate and will rub up against legs and purr very loudly! He LOVES to cuddle up on the couch and watch Netflix, and eat pretty much throughout the day (don’t we all??). He really enjoys pigeon-watching through the window and playing with a string/rope when he’s feeling inclined to do so. He loves to be pet and scritched on his head and shoulders on his own terms, but can get overly stimulated. He doesn’t like to be touched on his hind side or tail and may communicate with a swat, hiss or a soft bite but never has caused any damage from it.",2023-07-08 16:27:17+00:00,2023-07-08 17:09:22+00:00

18988012,description,"Days with Ocean Pacific are filled with love and affection – This cat was made for cuddles and scritches! As soon as he walked in the door, Ocean Pacific wasted no time making himself right at home. He's happy curled up beside you on the couch, lounging on your bed or sprawled out on the kitchen floor in hopes he can convince you to open another can of cat food. He’s always happy to see you and genuinely likes being around people (how else would he get all those glorious chin scritches??). Most of his time is spent being chill, but there are a few daily bouts of adorable playful energy chasing a toy mouse or catnip ball. Even at his most energetic he doesn’t scratch or bite - he’s definitely a lover not a fighter. He has a funny phobia of wand toys, but will go for a piece of string when he’s in the mood for some exercise. Ocean Pacific has FeLV, so needs to be adopted as a single cat or with another FeLV cat. Although most cats with FeLV have a much shorter lifespan than other cats, Ocean Pacific is currently healthy and would be so happy to find his forever home.

18990433,description,"Orion is a chill chonky-faced lap cat destined for the good life. Shy at first, Orion opens up to be such a loving cuddle bug with many head scratches, churus, and a little bit of time. When he’s not snoozing, Orion can be found chatting to himself in what is believed to be a chewbacca dialect. Orion has a calm chill energy, and will snooze in his favorite beds by you for hours as you work. He is ever-patient with a young spicy resident, and would do well either in a home with friendlier felines or alone.",2023-07-08 16:27:17+00:00,2023-07-08 17:09:22+00:00

19014845,description,"Pluto is a very sweet and active boy who is very curious to explore new spaces. He purrs quite a bit and likes to rub up against legs.  He is often amenable to being picked up and snuggled, while other times preferring more space (particularly in the evenings!). He likes to know what is happening and will follow you to the restroom and keep you company. He will often curl up at your feet or sit next to you on the couch if he sees you settled in one place. He likes to play but is not a fan of toys that make squeaky noises. He gets a bit startled by loud noises and quick movements, so a home without children may be best.",2023-07-08 16:27:17+00:00,2023-07-08 17:09:22+00:00

She’s energetic and adores toys of all kinds (especially anything with feathers). She’s always up for interactive play with a wand toy, but also happy to play by herself with her catnip mouse. Serena can be a little shy at first, but is easily won over with scritches and treats. She’s still learning about laps and hasn’t figured out that she can crawl up herself, but in the meantime she’s happy to be placed there for snuggles. Her other hobbies include following her human around the house, watching the washing machine spin (she’s absolutely mesmerized), and rolling around cutely on the floor in hopes of getting pats. Serena is curious and friendly with other cats and needs to be adopted into a home with a playful companion — adoptions for her as a single cat will be ignored.",2023-07-08 16:27:17+00:00,2023-07-08 17:09:22+00:00

She’ll purr non-stop, offer you her chin, and give you loving headbutts. Sipha was likely someone’s pet at some point, but has been living on the streets for a while. She was being fed by a kind person and has had at least two litters. As a result, while she adores humans, she’s a wary cat and frightens easily at loud noises and sudden movements. Don’t worry about her disappearing under the bed for too long, however. Just offer her cuddles and she’ll come right back out. Sipha is a very chill cat (not a whole lot of zoomies to deal with) and would do better as your one-and-only pet in a household free of children.",2023-07-08 16:27:17+00:00,2023-07-08 17:09:22+00:00

She would do well with a patient adopter willing to go at her pace, especially since she appreciates her independence. Sunnydale is FIV+ and will live a normal, healthy life when provided with quality care such as a balanced diet and yearly wellness exams (like any cat). As FIV+ is not transmittable between neutered/spayed cats under normal circumstances, we are happy for FIV+ cats to mingle with FIV- cats in their adoptive homes.",2023-07-08 16:27:17+00:00,2023-07-08 17:09:22+00:00

Since he is so social, he will be happiest in a home with people who are able to give him the attention he seeks and who either work from home or have a flexible schedule and won’t leave him alone for extended periods of time over multiple days. Yoda is a lowkey cat, who spends most of the day napping in a quiet spot. He lives up to his name, and really does look like a version of baby Yoda with his wide-set ears and sleepy eyes. He’s not a picky eater and gets chatty when he’s hungry and will tell you he wants food with his sweet meow! He likes to play with wand toys. At night he sleeps on the foot of the bed or will climb up and curl up into a body nook. He is not a fan of closed doors.

18844592,description,"Baby Shark is a sweet tuxedo who likes taking naps on soft beds, purring during long combing sessions, and swatting at wand toys. She loves scratches under her chin and behind her ears, and will reward you with loud, loving purrs and flashes of her belly. She gets along with other cats in her foster home, but because of her timid personality and sweet disposition, she would thrive in a quiet home where she can get the most care and attention. She is a low-key, trusting kitty that easily adapts to new environments and has a lot of love to give.",,2023-07-08 16:27:17+00:00

17834315,description,"Bobsled is turning into quite a spunky lovey gentleman. A tuxedo with white handlebar mustaches from the Bronx, he might look tough but he will melt you with his tiny meow and Puss-in-Boots eyes. Bobsled loves play hunting with the wire wand and toys on ribbons. He will even stalk a yoga mat inched along the ground with your toes! He gets creative -- pretending not to care, or hiding under a chair…and then he strikes! He loves treats and might accidentally scratch if he gets too excited, but he is nothing but love. Bobsled nurses adorably on soft blankets and perches atop boxes. He will sit with you but he's not a lap cat (yet) - he will lounge nearby and send you loving blink kisses. He likes being pet from the shoulders back - he isn't on board with ear scritches yet. Bob is quiet and non-aggressive and might benefit from a mellow similar-age or slightly older feline companion to show him the ropes. He gets agitated when he hears dogs and may not do well with one in the home. He may do well in a home with older children if they can respect his need for space. Bobsled is in need of an echocardiogram due to having a heart murmur and we'd be happy to arrange an appointment at our next rescue clinic.",,2023-07-08 16:27:17+00:00

Buffy will bring you her favorite ball(s) while you are in bed for a good game of fetch. She is comfortable with being picked up, but doesn’t like being held too long. She likes to roam around the home exploring every corner and climbing onto high places (think top of the refrigerator). Buffy is fond of treats, all shapes and sizes, as well as eating her meals on time and she’ll let you know if she’s hungry with some chirps. She seems pretty active and will likely do well in a home where she can get plenty of attention and may enjoy having a feline friend. She would most likely do best in a home with older children as she can still be a bit skittish and nip when scared, but she is making great progress and is a total delight.",,2023-07-08 16:27:17+00:00

She is very curious and will be the first to explore a new area and is comfortable enjoying your company from a close distance.

She enjoys playing with the cat wand and is NUTS for catnip. Overall, she’s very sweet and just wants to hang with the humans! Her little meow when she wants pats is the cutest thing ever. She does occasionally scratch at furniture but is adjusting to the cat post more.

Understandably, he took some time to get settled, but is now a charming, cheeky fellow.  Although not much of a lapcat, he likes to keep tabs on his foster while they work from home and is sometimes very chatty with his kitty babbling. His favorite pastimes include chasing after a tennis ball, enjoying churu fresh from the tube, and lounging around the house. Just give him a chance and Cowboy will be a delightful companion to the right home. Plus, as a polydactyl cat, he's got some adorable thumbs. He's cautiously beginning to accept pets and sometimes even appreciates being carried.

18166753,description,"Cut and Copy are two extremely playful sisters! They’re full of energy and love to play — whether with each other, toys, or your foot under a blanket. They enjoy running around chasing each other with toys in their mouths and climbing and jumping around on the cat tree. They’re easily entranced by anything that moves be it a wand toy or your hair. These sisters also really love each other. You’ll find them snuggled up together and making biscuits on each other. They’re great with the resident cats, constantly coming up to their resident brother and rubbing against him until he gives them licks. Copy can be quite vocal when she wants attention and will let you know when she wants pets — you’ll quickly learn the range of chitters and polite meows she uses. She’s the alpha of the two and will climb up to you to insist you give her more affection. If you try to stop petting her she’ll nuzzle into your legs and let you know you’re not done! She’ll reward you for your pets with purrs and the occasional flop on her back for belly rubs! Cut is still learning to trust humans and will avoid being picked up, but once you have her in your arms and are petting her she will easily doze off. She also accepts love in the form of Churu cat treats! She’s incredibly playful and is more likely to be found running around with a mouse toy in her mouth than her sister. With some consistent love and affection she’ll learn that cuddles are also nice!",,2023-07-08 16:27:17+00:00

You’ll find her cleaning up her siblings BFF Cuttlefish, making sure everyone is in tip-top shape to take charge of the day ahead. Cuttlefish has the most heart-warming, endearing round eyes. He’s still a bit unsure of us humans but is warming up a little bit more each day. You’ll find him first in line for breakfast and Churu. This cutie is now comfortable coming up into your lap so long as Churu is on the menu. This is when you can sneak a few quick pets in – soon enough he’ll be onboard for endless cuddles. He’s the athlete of the family and loves to play with a string toy or kick a ball around (do we have our next international futbol star?!).",,2023-07-08 16:27:17+00:00

18861795,description,"Jumping beans Emeril and Rachel Ray are the tastiest tabbies around. Emeril (white nose) is bigger and still pretends that he doesn't want to be held, but he will start purring the moment you pick him up. He is very curious and loves to explore exciting new places (behind dresser drawers) and try new flavors (dog food). Rachel Ray (smaller, brown nose) is most definitely not the brains of the operation, but she makes up for it in cuteness. Her favorite toy is currently a plastic fork and she will scream nonstop when she can't find her brother. These kittens still need some support to continue being brave and friendly and would thrive in a home with patient humans who will give them lots of cuddles — they both love belly rubs!

She will ask for pets and wrap her long tail around your legs as soon as you enter the room and won't stop until the scritches are up to her satisfaction. She loves to play with literally anything – from a fancy electronic toy to a crumpled aluminum foil. She has the speed and agility of an olympic cathlete. This gorgeous girl with multicolored toe beans can be a bit sassy at times. We believe she didn’t have an age appropriate partner in her previous home as she seems to suffer from Single Kitten Syndrome – luckily, the Brooklyn Cat Cafe offers intense rehabilitation and Feisty is currently in training to be a polite member of feline society. Despite her current feelings about making new friends, Feisty needs to be adopted with a young and playful cat companion. Applications for her as a single will be ignored.",,2023-07-08 16:27:17+00:00

18844861,description,"Though these two bundles of cuddles, purrs and shenanigans found their way inside in very different ways they have fast become best friends. Stowaway (brown tabby) was rescued after hitching a ride in the chassis of two different cars. After a driving tour through central Brooklyn his last ride was brought to a local mechanic who kindly lifted the car and excavated Stowy. He hissed for about 10 minutes and has since been a non-stop purr machine. This boy is full of light and joy, eagerly greeting you with purrs and melty eyes as soon as you walk in the room asking to be picked up and pet. He loves to climb (even a leg will do though he is being discouraged from doing this), is thrilled with any wand toy and is a Churu fanatic. He finds joy in everything - a box, a scrap of paper, his own tail and is easily entertained and endlessly entertaining. Fennel (white and gray) is one of a large litter of kittens that were living under a gazebo in a large community garden underneath the 3 train tracks. More cautious than his BFF, he nevertheless begins to purr and nuzzle as soon as he is pet. This sweet boy has remarkably soft, silky fur, loves to chase toys that are thrown for him and is obsessed with little fish treats. Fennel, while still a little shy, is expressive about letting you know what he’s thinking - he meows when separated from Stowy, even for a little while, and lets out the most ridiculously sweet chirps when excited. If you’re looking for kittens that are equal parts charming, fun and loving, these are your boys!",,2023-07-08 16:27:17+00:00

17550587,description,"Fifi and Rufus are an adorable pair of kittens who start off shy, but open up more every day. They love treats, chasing each other and playing with toys. They love to explore, and are particularly enamored by the sink, but also love finding the coziest spot to cuddle up for a nap together. These two are a bonded duo who really love each other, and are frequently checking-in on the other. Fifi is a black and white playful beauty who loves running laps and believes anything can be a toy if you use your imagination. She greets her foster parents by the door and demands pets immediately upon their homecoming- if you're not acknowledging her as quickly as she’d like, she will remind you through the cutest little cry and repeated head-butts. Rufus also loves to play and explore, but often prefers to cuddle up with resident cats and demand a bath from them. His people-love can easily be bought with tasty treats once he's taken a few days to make sure you're a friend not foe. If you’ve passed his test he will start sneaking into bed to cuddle you (only after you’ve fallen asleep and he’s worked up some courage). Fifi and Rufus are a shy quirky duo but that doesn’t mean they aren’t loving and affectionate in their own ways. Fifi loves to be pet and played with, but isn’t yet a cuddler. Rufus started off like a hissy little punk, but quickly became a cuddling purr machine (on his terms). Fifi and Rufus would excel in a quiet home with someone willing to give them the time they need to acclimate and blossom. They have a lot of love to give and are the source of many smiles and laughs in their foster home.",,2023-07-08 16:27:17+00:00

18666916,description,"Focaccia and Princess Consuela Banana Hammock are two best friends who love to cuddle together to show how much they love each other! Focaccia (grey tabby) is the quintessential kitten experience. He loves food, cuddling, and making biscuits wherever he can. He loves to play with string toys and will jump 2 feet in the air to catch – or try to catch – a feathery temptation. When he’s not meowing for food and/or pets, Focaccia likes to lounge in the sunlight and look out of the window. He is incredibly sweet and quick to trust humans and other cats alike. Princess Consuela Banana has the softest fur and is the ultimate cuddler and playmate to Focaccia.. This one-eyed calico beauty loves pillows, head pets, and playing, whether with a playmate or by herself. She’s happy to entertain herself with a toy, a hair tie, or even her own tail. She’s very food motivated and loyal once you’ve won her trust. Because of her one eye, sometimes her coordination isn’t one hundred percent, so she’ll fling herself around your space with abandon. She is extremely loving and sweet. Put her on your lap and she will happily sit on your lap for hours.",,2023-07-08 16:27:17+00:00

She wants to do whatever Galumph does, but also loves to get pets and gives sweet kisses. Galumph is FIV+ and will live a normal, healthy life when provided with quality care such as a balanced diet and yearly wellness exams (like any cat).

18720673,description,"The Hawthorne kittens didn’t have the best start in life. They were trapped in a yard with 20 other cats and the owner asked that all of them be euthanized. Of course, that wasn’t happening and we were happy to snap them up and introduce them to the good, warm, treat-filled, life. These four kittens may have begun as tiny hissy monsters, but now they are playful and snuggly (especially if you happen to have a can of food handy or, even more especially, churu treats). Young Goodman Brown was the first to realize humans were really just giant vehicles for treat dispensing and pets. He’s also a champ with the wand toy and a scourge to toy mice everywhere. Feathertop is the brave explorer of the bunch, always keen to find the highest perch or sneak out of his foster room to chirrup agreeably at the horrified resident cats. Blithedale Romance is a very charming calico who took a bit to come around but is now a happy snuggler. The Great Carbuncle is a relatively rare orange lady cat. Terrible eye infections before she was rescued have made her eyes slightly cloudy but she sees well and is just as likely to pounce on a flying toy as her siblings. She will be the wariest initially but also the first to purr when you corner her for a snuggle! They are adoptable in mix and match pairs, spayed and neutered, and all ready for their forever homes!",,2023-07-08 16:27:17+00:00

18692278,description,"Meet Hubert and Hamish, twin brothers with big dreams! When they’re not learning how to become kings of the savannah, they can be found curled up together in a ball, grooming each other tenderly until someone starts a wrestling match. Hamish (half white ear) is sweet and tender. He can be shy around multiple humans or strangers, but once you see him stretch out and unwind from paw-tip to tail-tip he’s likely to start purring before you even have a chance to pat him. He loves snacks, pats, snacks, chin scratches, snacks, belly rubbing, oh and snacks! Hubert (dark ears) is bold and curious. He’s the first to venture out to find new spots to explore and high spots with good views for napping. Once he finds something good (or just gets a bit bored and wants a playmate!) he’ll call over his brother to come join him.  Hubert is a bit more comfortable around people and getting him to start purring is a great way to get Hamish looking for some human attention too! We couldn’t think of separating these two, so if you have room in your hearts (and enough food!) for two, Hubert and Hamish could be the purr-fect companions and playmates for you!",,2023-07-08 16:27:17+00:00

She loves chin rubs, dinner time, and stealing socks from the drawer and sprinting down the hall with them. Valerie (with the bright gold eyes and black nose) is clever, affectionate, and very social. She loves head rubs, little butt scritches, and napping in hilarious and improbable places (current favorite: inside the cupboard with the shopping bags). Despite their dapper tuxedos, these bonded sisters are extremely low maintenance. Both just want full bellies, a good romp around the apartment chasing toys, and a cozy place to cuddle (a warm lap preferred).

He’s still learning how to meow, and it’s hilarious. His eyes open so big, it’s not even funny. Krankenwagen absolutely loves being brushed and scratched. Krank will push his big face right into your hand to ask for more pets. At the sight of his brush or waggling fingers, Krankenwagen will start purring, rolling around on his back, showing his soft white tummy. He is a total purr machine, and sometimes purrs at the mere sight of people. This young cat needs patient companions, but once you have some of his trust, Krank transforms into an adorable pet who is becoming more and more playful every day.",,2023-07-08 16:27:17+00:00

He has big eyes to match his big heart as he and Pivot roll around like tumbleweeds. His nickname is Big Buddha – partly because he has an appetite to match his stature, but also because of his loving demeanor.  His love of food comes with other perks: namely, to pass out and roll around with a food coma which leaves his tummy wide open for plenty of belly rubs. Pivot will follow you around and curl up wherever you are. She loves to purr, give headbutts and dive-bomb into a clean laundry pile.   She’s extremely playful and initiates a lot of good shenanigans with Lugnut when she’s not sleeping in that nook between your pillow and sheets..

After some pre-bed cuddles she will happily sleep at your feet for the whole night. Peaberry was found outside of a semi-managed colony and it is presumed that she was recently dumped. She’s a calm and affectionate companion and she would love to tell you her whole story herself when she meets you -- however, she knows to stay quiet and out of the way if you are working from home.

18961091,description,"Roxi and Rifi are incredibly sweet four year old cats who are looking for a new home after a relative with a cat allergy moved in. They both love sitting on window sills and watching the world pass by outside, and will climb up to the highest spot in any room to look over their home. Both cats are more than happy to get scritches and will both come right up to you and force their way under your hand. Although generally pretty mellow, if you wave toys at them, they will happily swing their heads in unison and follow it with their eyes. They love eating treats straight from your hand and are incredibly gentle! Both cats are perfectly content with being in the same room with many people, and don't get overwhelmed too easily. They can tolerate being pet by children, but get startled somewhat easily around loud noises. Both cats have heart murmurs, neither of which need medication.",,2023-07-08 16:27:17+00:00

18949146,description,"Sage and Houdini are quite the pair!  They are inquisitive, playful yet calm and sometimes just downright silly. Sage is the curious one, a gray and white tabby cat with all the courage and cattitude! Quite mischievous, she will find her way into something and look at you with a quizzical “who meee?” look. She is likely to come headbutt, snuggle under an arm or elbow or to climb up on you and purring while she makes biscuits on your lap. If she feels like you are not paying her enough attention she will come and curl herself up beside you and chirp and trill at you until you give her pets. Houdini is an all black tiny panther who follows Sage and their foster brother around. He is very playful and likes to run and pounce (mainly on Sage) and has gotten much more comfortable chasing after flying feathers and red dots. He will let you pick him up and go all in for a snuggle, but he prefers a little solitude and loves to find a good hiding place to take naps when he has had enough human and cat interaction.  With that said, if he hears anyone else having any fun at all, he will come running.",,2023-07-08 16:27:17+00:00

Rescued at a couple weeks old with their siblings, mom and aunt, these munchkins enjoyed several weeks of undivided attention from two cat and several human caretakers -- which means they have not only learned how to play like pros, but they have had a lot of cuddle practice. They are feisty, playful, funny and very loving. They are very bonded with one another and do everything together -- where one goes, the other follows. Both are very affectionate with their humans and they will take any opportunity to be right next to you wherever you are. Sometimes they can be a little mischievous and are very skilled at identifying hiding spots from which you will never be able to find them until they decide to come out of hiding and grace the world again with their happy presence! Sam and Misa love to wrestle and explore and keep each other entertained with their shenanigans and then pass out curled up together. They are good with kids and other cats and most likely would enjoy a friendly dog.",,2023-07-08 16:27:17+00:00

He likes to explore and play with everything he can find (even a tissue). He is a real foodie and loves treats, but sometimes he will be more interested in human food than his own. Saint Cyr doesn't like cuddles that much, but he will greet you with rubs even if you are just coming out of your room. And they know tricks!

18636992,description,"Toffee is gorgeous and spunky with a long fluffy tail that often makes her look like a foxy cat. Toffee is super friendly and sweet-natured. She loves cuddles and plopping herself on her humans or following them around the house. She is energetic, playful and very curious about other pets. You can often spot her head peeking out from around the corners, the stairs, or under the couch. She loves climbing on things, jumping near you undetected, and coming close to your food to remind you of her existence. Toffee needs to be adopted with another feline friend or to a home with an existing young cat. She loves treats and can do paw, high-five, sit, and come to her humans when she hears ‘come, Toffee, come’ or clicking sounds. She loves chasing and catching wand toys with dangling sparkling things and would play with about anything to keep her entertained. It’s fun to watch her do her zoomie session after she leaves the litter box and her high fun energy often brings a smile to her hard-working exhausted humans. Toffee has a heart murmur, but it is no more likely than anything else to develop into more severe heart issues.",,2023-07-08 16:27:17+00:00

Found as kittens, this brother and sister were rescued shortly before their mother was hit by a car. They were slightly older kittens when they were rescued, so it took them some time to settle in and fully trust humans. Luckily, their main strategy to avoid detection was to hide under their bed (somehow they never realized how we were able to keep finding them). Now much braver, Toil (black and white) is a real social butterfly (will the puns ever end?) while Trouble is generally found watching cat TV either on the big screen or in real life next to our deluxe-sized rat habitat.",,2023-07-08 16:27:17+00:00

He also has a love-heart on the roof of his mouth, which is very apt because he will be your mini shadow of love. Way is conventionally adorable and gets away with many naughty things because of her good looks and charming demeanor. She is very curious, energetic, loves to climb (and fall), short attention span, and a little more hyperactive compare to Will. If Will is giving you his attention, Way likes to barge right in and demands she’s part of the party! Once she’s done being adventurous and playful, Way has her calm side.

His fur is very soft and he enjoys pets around his cheeks and forehead. It is truly a joy to come home to these big lovable lugs every day.

They are spayed, free from parasites, , vaccinated, tested negative for FIV/FeLV and microchipped. Petra and Paula must be adopted together. They are being fostered in Midwood and their rescuer can arrange either a video or in person meeting. *Courtesy Posting: This cat is being independently offered for adoption by a rescuer who is not a representative of BBAWC or Brooklyn Cat Cafe.

18666840,description,"With dazzling golden eyes and a peaceful disposition, Scotty is a delightful companion with nothing but love to give. This guy loves a good nap and is happiest when he's getting head and chin pets. In between naps and pets, he likes to spend time on his scratch pad. Although he's not sure what to make of catnip, it sure does bring out his party side! If he isn't napping, exploring, by your side, or on his scratch pad, you might find him admiring his reflection in the mirror. Love this guy's confidence! At bedtime, he'll give you a quick goodnight cuddle before settling at your feet for the night. Scotty is super easy going, so if you don't want him in bed, he's likely to happily find another cozy spot. He is around five and would do best as an only cat. He may be ok with older children as long as they are gentle with him. Scotty LOVES human visitors. He quickly comes to greet new guests, making sure everyone has an opportunity to give him pets or play. But Scotty is way too cool to be overbearing--he mostly just wants to chill out where the action is. Scotty is a delightful kitty with so much love to give. He’s social and playful, but earnest in his own hilarious way.",2023-07-08 17:09:22+00:00,

He is quick to warm up and wants to be by your side no matter what—scrolling through Instagram? Him, too. Cleaning the bathroom? He will supervise. He will let you know when it is time to eat. He plays hard and naps harder. A lovebug through and through, you will fall in love with his big purr. Epcot is a gray and white girlie, Epcot loves to do her own thing in her own time. She is slower to warm up than her brother but will gladly accept toys and treats until she’s ready to cuddle up. When it is time to rest, she wants the spot next to you. She loves toy mice, cardboard boxes, and strings. Epcot enjoys playing with toys, Churu, and whatever Adventureland is playing with. Both kitties love to snuggle with each other for naps and with you overnight! Epcot is a little skittish and relies on Adventureland to let her know when things are okay. These two kittens love to play and they love attention. These two cats are bonded and must be adopted together -- applications for just one of them will not be processed. Please note that they may not yet be spayed/neutered -- their adoption fee may be higher to cover their surgeries.",2023-07-08 17:09:22+00:00,

19452563,description,"Introducing Rhaenyra and Aegon: the dynamic duo of kitten cuteness! Rhaenyra is a remarkably agile bundle of energy. With her tail perpetually standing tall, she'll keep herself entertained for hours as she pounces, chases, and engages in epic battles with her favorite toy jellyfish. Aegon, Rhaenyra's brother, is the perfect balance to her playful nature. While he shares her love for excitement, he approaches new experiences with a touch more caution (though he is adorably curious). Aegon absolutely loves belly rubs, and you'll often find him rolling over for some well-deserved pampering. When it's time to unwind, both kittens will happily join you on the couch, cuddling up for a cozy evening of TV watching. Rhaenyra and Aegon are not only the best of friends, but they also effortlessly extend their playful and affectionate nature to other cats. They will be a perfect addition to your home as a solo pair or as new members of your multi-cat household. In addition to their fun lil personalities, Rhaenyra and Aegon are exceptionally well-behaved kittens. They've mastered the art of keeping their claws and teeth to themselves – you won't have to worry about them scratching your furniture or nipping you. If you’re looking for a duo that will turn your living room into a playground of hilarity and your lap into the Iron Throne of Snuggles, these two are for you.",2023-07-08 17:09:22+00:00,

17351058,description,"Angelo loves you already and hasn't even met you yet! This cat is truly the life of the party. From the moment he landed in his foster home, he's been nothing but purrs and leg rubs and face rubs and nose bumps and snuggles. His hefty brow and chubby cheeks may give him the illusion of a grouchy disposition, but don't let that fool you! He's almost always purring and thinks hanging with humans is the absolute best so be prepared to give him a lot of attention. Angelo doesn't really notice or mind other cats or dogs, his main passion is humans, and he will declare it to you with all the Italian passion implied by his name. If you want a social, attention-loving, and authoritative feline friend, Angelo is the cat for you! Angelo is FIV+ and will live a normal healthy and long life when provided with quality care such as a balanced diet and yearly wellness exams (like any cat). As FIV+ is not transmittable between neutered/spayed cats under normal circumstances, we are happy for FIV+ cats to mingle with FIV- cats in their adoptive homes.",2023-07-08 17:09:22+00:00,

19384005,description,"Bebe is a shy, gentle girl who, deep down, loves head scratches and squeezy treats even though she tries her best to hide it. She will definitely need some time and lots of pep talks to help her feel safe and comfortable, though she might momentarily forget and stretch out belly side up if you’re giving her a good brushing. She is small, plump, and has round, expressive eyes, which will make her look like a kitten forever! She is extremely gentle even when stuck in scary situations (like being put in the carrier or meeting new people) - she won’t use her claws on anything other than making biscuits and her teeth for anything other than eating crunchy treats. That being said, she will likely need to stay in a quiet home with no other pets. It will be so rewarding to watch her grow into the confident and loving cat she is!",2023-07-08 17:09:22+00:00,

19475403,description,"Carton and Parcel are two beautiful and playful cats. They were found in a taped-up box full of kittens left outside Brooklyn Cat Café a few months ago. Since then, they’d come a long way in learning to love and trust humans. Parcel is an orange and gray cat who’s very social and loves to cuddle. She can be a bit shy at first and tends to hide from strangers, but once she’s comfortable, she’ll follow you around the house, loudly demanding attention and pets. She’ll even jump into your lap while you’re working from home and crawl into bed with you to cuddle. Carton is the pure gray one and definitely takes more time to come around to people, but can also be so affectionate once she does. She’s a little more reserved than Parcel but still loves sitting next to her preferred human and having her fur stroked – not so much being picked up and carried. Parcel loves playing with other cats, and they are both good with friendly dogs that won’t chase them. They may not do as well with pushier dogs or young children.",2023-07-08 17:09:22+00:00,

He is often happy to chase certain toys (or even his tail) on his own when he gets the zoomies, and occasionally he even requests to play fetch. Casey doesn’t mind water and has been known to splash around the bathroom sink or even the shower. He loves people and may get along with children and with other cats or a dog. When he doesn’t have the zoomies, Casey loves to chill out, and can often be seen lounging contentedly with his spotted belly on display.",2023-07-08 17:09:22+00:00,

19335096,description,"This sweet brother and sister duo liven up the house with their playful antics and their energy. Though they have different – but strong – personalities, this bonded pair does EVERYTHING together. From sharing food, toys, hiding spots, naps, treats (oh how they love Churu treats), and cuddles, these two are inseparable, and their love for each other cannot be denied. Earthquake (brown DSH with spots) is fearless and loves to mosey on over throughout the day to say hello to you or cuddle. He is full of playful energy and is always looking for a good time. His sister Wildfire (white/black DSH) trusts her brother and is always one step behind him joining in on the fun. Wildfire takes her time warming up to you, but it is a beautiful feeling when she starts to trust and says hello to you (in her own Wildfire way of course). She loves to investigate new corners of the house and most importantly, she loves her brother. Earthquake understands his sister and worries and calls out for her if he cannot find his partner in crime. Similarly, Wildfire gains her confidence and thirst for adventure from her brother who is always close by with a toy for them to share. These two kittens are the epitome of love and loyalty between siblings, and they compliment each other’s personality so well. Best way to discover their personalities? Throw a toy in the air and watch both of them lunge at it! You can tell immediately which of the two is adventurous and which one is the ‘genius hunter’ in the family. Regardless of their different approaches to life and affection, there is no denying that these two will keep your house and heart full of joy and laughter.",2023-07-08 17:09:22+00:00,

19180805,description,"Extra Cuddles is a whole lot of cat with even more personality! This hefty lady (currently 19 pounds) takes a little while to warm up to you and feel safe in her surroundings, but your patience will be rewarded once she comes out of her shell. In her time with her foster so far, Extra Cuddles has revealed herself to be a hilariously charming girl with strong opinions and a healthy amount of sass. She is also secretly a huge sweetheart with a love of ear scratches, but you have to get past her “tough” side first. Her extra weight hasn’t stunted her curiosity, as she’ll spend most of her waking hours exploring her new digs (she is adamant about someday being able to climb into the bathtub). As long as she continues to slowly and steadily shed those pounds with a 100% wet food diet, her new owner will be responsible for drastically improving her quality of life. Think about how rewarding it will be to see E.C. regain mobility and be able to jump and climb around to her heart’s content! Extra Cuddles has a lot of strict preferences on how she likes to be pet and handled by her caretakers; She’s very easy to read! For the most part, she’ll come to you when she’s looking for affection and head-bonks and she’ll leave when she’s ready to be left alone. Sometimes she can get a bit over-stimulated with back scratches or brushing which leads to growling and (extremely halfhearted) hissing, so she would likely do best in a home with no other cats or young children to test her boundaries.",2023-07-08 17:09:22+00:00,

He is quick to make himself comfortable and was purring and asking for pets within minutes of getting to his foster home. He likes to sleep in bed (and steal the pillows), pounce on catnip toys, and get ALL of the pets from ALL of the people. He is happy to just relax quietly during the day, but will excitedly greet you with chirps when you get home.

He also loves to give his foster's dog side hugs ever now and then which will just make your heart melt! Folie is the absolute cutest and is such a cuddly kitten! His favorite thing to do is explore and play spontaneous games of tag with his brother. Once he’s done, he loves to find comfy posts and chairs to curl up in.

He loves hanging out next to humans or between their legs, playing with a variety of toys (string toys, balls, mice toys, etc), and being a chatterbox. Instead of purring he will honk like a goose when you pet him and once you hit that sweet spot he will roll over and show you his belly.

19471351,description,"Gumshoe is an absolute gem you don’t want to miss out on. He is a large, gray tabby with a bushy tail, tufted ears, and silky-soft fur. He also has an abnormally large head, which you will only get a true sense of once you start petting him. But you better not stop petting him. He’ll be disappointed if you do. This is a very sweet boy. He will glue himself to your side whenever you are anywhere he can find a comfy spot for himself and will even flop over onto your feet while you go to the bathroom. He only occasionally sits in laps, but considering his heft that’s probably a good thing. He meows very little (no morning yowling to wake you up) and purrs quietly but frequently. Just talk to him and he starts the motor and biscuit-making! He will absolutely want to sleep in your bed. In fact, the bed is his favorite place in the whole world. It allows him to sprawl out on his back, with all four legs in the air and his belly totally exposed, in the most shameless pose. It’s sort of dog-like. And speaking of dogs, he eats like one. Put his food out for him and by the time you turn back around, it’s gone. He’s not picky either. Gumshoe is also a chill cat. He rarely misbehaves, mostly keeps off counters and tables, scratches responsibly, and will only ask for attention in sweet, non-obnoxious ways. However, be aware that he does get middle-of-the-night zoomies and will tear around your home, chasing his favorite toys. You can almost tell time by his zoomies! Also, exercise caution while walking. He delights in tangling with ankles and he will appear between your feet as if out of nowhere. Gumshoe would do well with children. He tolerates annoyances and will only nip softly once he has reached his breaking point",2023-07-08 17:09:22+00:00,

19458682,description,"Hanger and Wagyu could have easily been named Yin and Yang for their different and complementary personalities. Hanger, with predominantly white fur and a half spotted mustache, is a true beauty, a hearty eater, playful, curious and quite literally hangs in the arm of a three year old without much fuss. She’s spunky but calms easily, loves a belly rub or neck/chin tickle, and plays gently with her brother and fellow humans. Wagyu is more cautious, tinier, but equally as playful and full of sweetness from ears to tail. He loudly purrs the moment he’s stroked or picked up and the little motor doesn’t stop. He’s also the caretaker of the two, moving aside easily for his hungry sister, and grooms her whiskers and head when relaxing. Like the wag of a dog’s tail, Wagyu’s tireless purr will melt your heart. This 14 week old sibling pair were part of a larger litter slated to be sold to a pet store. Thankfully they were surrendered to the cafe to be adored by their foster humans and are waiting to be adopted as a pair for their permanent home.  Living with 3 and 5 yr old humans, they’re proven easy going and adaptable. They will keep your lap company and bring much fun and joy to your life.",2023-07-08 17:09:22+00:00,

She’s also a renowned biscuit maker whose work ethic will wow you—even when tired, she still takes the time to knead. When they’ve spent their energy, they like nothing more than to curl up on your lap or intertwined together on the couch. They love pets, and Gooey likes some light bonks on the butt. Gooey also likes to simulate her own waterpark experience by splashing around in her water bowl sometimes, something Hazey doesn’t understand the appeal of. These babies are still figuring out scratching and biting, like all kittens, but they’re smart and respond well to distraction with a toy. They’re impossible not to fall in love with!",2023-07-08 17:09:22+00:00,

19426351,description,"Heavy Howard is the best biscuit maker in Brooklyn. He’s an adorable three-year old boy who is ready to shower his new family with lots of cuddles and love. Howard was a street cat in his former life, but other than believing he can explore your spice cabinet undetected, he seems to be adjusting well to a life full of napping on blankets and meowing loudly when he’d like your attention. Howard is a friendly boy who does well around old and new friends alike! He’ll fall asleep on anyone (especially if your lap is lined with a blanket/tshirt/something to his liking). You always know when Howard is around because you can hear his purrs from a mile away! He’d do well in a household where his family loves both sides of him: his rambunctious laser boy personality before bed and his floppy, cuddly daytime personality. Howard would be the perfect addition to a loving household!",2023-07-08 17:09:22+00:00,

She prefers human company over the company of other cats and would do best as the only cat in the house. While she’s not much of a lap cat, she does love to be near her humans at all times. She will follow you into the kitchen when you get up to get a snack, and is happy to share your work chair or your bed, or just curl up nearby, wherever you happen to be at the moment. Honey is quite vocal and will often treat her humans to a throaty meow and a hearty rumbling purr. Honey has a thyroid condition that is easily managed with a small and inexpensive pill placed in her food or in a treat twice daily.",2023-07-08 17:09:22+00:00,

19189785,description,"Huck & Norma were left alone in a Bronx apartment when their family moved out at the end of March 2023. Their loss, because Huck and Norma are the sweetest pair you’ll ever see! This brother and sister duo spend their days playing with mouse toys and watching out the windows, and spend their evenings snoozing away. Huck the best big brother any cat could ask for. Whenever Norma gets lonely, she meows for some love and attention. Huck will get up from whatever he’s doing and run to her. They nuzzle for a bit and will then play or take a nap together. When he’s not doing brotherly duties, Huck is a total love bug. He loves to curl up next to his people and quietly purrs with a big smile. Norma is the shyer of the two and has been working very hard to become more courageous. She’s a small lady who loves her brother more than anything, and her mouse toy is a close second. She follows her people around the apartment and is more than happy to take a nap a few feet away. She’s still a little skittish in general, but has come a long way with her fosters and has grown into a curious and friendly cat. These two cats are bonded and must be adopted together -- applications for just one of them will not be processed.",2023-07-08 17:09:22+00:00,

19380732,description,"Lavender Haze is an adorable girl rescued from a hoarding situation with over 60 cats. After having spent so much time being one of many, she’s ready to be able to keep all of her peoples’ attention for herself. Lavender is low key, low maintenance, and independent cat. She isn’t the kind of cat who will run up to you, begging for attention, but she likes to be pet if offered! What she can’t resist is meal time; tasty treats are her favorite. She is curious and playful in short bursts, and after each mini expedition she returns to her favorite nooks and sleeping spots. Because Lavender haze lived in a home with so many other cats, we’re unsure how much interaction she’s had with humans. Because of this, she is uncomfortable with certain things like being picked up and held. It’s possible that this will change over time, but she needs an adopter who’s willing to follow her lead and respect her boundaries. Lavender haze is the polite roommate you’ve always wanted!

16547285,description,"Marcelline and Marjorie are an incredibly bonded, very shy pair of best friends. They are around 7 years old and have lived inside for many years, but are still very wary of getting too close to humans. They appreciate us for opening cans of food and cleaning the litterbox, but in general, they would prefer if we would stop trying to pet them. That said, we are obsessed with them. They are favorites of many of the cafe volunteers and we all spend a lot of time admiring them (albeit from afar). They are adored by all of the other cats. M+M are head over heels for each other and are rarely seen apart. When one is peckish, they both saunter over to the buffet together. When one needs a nap, the other will either join in on the snooze or sit nearby to monitor the situation. These calm (and somewhat chubby) besties would be a very easy-going pair of cats to keep you company without smothering you with too much attention.",2023-07-08 17:09:22+00:00,

19380741,description,"Midnight Rain is a precious and adorably awkward girl rescued from a hoarding situation. She does enjoy other cats, but after having spent time with so many she also values her alone time. Her favorite thing is food! She loves food so much that she sometimes needs a little help getting out her energy before meal time. Having a play session prior to eating helps her burn away that excess energy so she can enjoy her food, and so she might be a little more patient while you’re preparing it. Midnight Rain loves scritches and pets in short bursts, but make sure you check with her both before and during so she doesn’t get overstimulated. As you get to know her, you’ll be able to understand her body language so you’ll have a better idea of when she’s up to being pet and when she’d prefer some space. Because of this, she’d do better in a home without any kids. Curious and playful and a bit timid, Midnight Rain would be a wonderful companion. She would especially appreciate if she could have another feline friend to bond with",2023-07-08 17:09:22+00:00,

Wherever you are is where Cowbell wants to be – even if you are showering, she prefers to be perched on the toilet lid where she can keep an eye on you. If you work from home, she’ll hop right on your desk, or supervise from a nearby chair.

19189674,description,"Pink Snoball exudes a cool confidence and is growing in his interest in pets and scritches every day. This laidback guy regularly chats with his foster and rubs up against her legs to say hello. He enjoys playing and nuzzling with cat buddies, but also enjoys solo play time and watching “cat TV” out the window. Snoball would benefit from an adopter who will develop a play routine to help him build his confidence and at least one other kitty buddy to snuggle up and play with outside his new human family. Definitely a sweet boy with a well-rounded vibe that balances cat naps, cuddles, conversation, and play time!",2023-07-08 17:09:22+00:00,

Zine is extremely sweet and will follow you everywhere, whether you’re working, napping, or watching TV. She will remind you to take healthy breaks from whatever screen you’re staring at by butting her head in between you and said screen. The only thing she might enjoy more than cuddle sessions with you is bonkers playtime inside cardboard boxes! Shilling might play a little bit harder to get at first, but she will immediately melt into a purring puddle for a good belly rub. Her favorite pastimes include hiding around the corner for a sneak attack during play time and curling up to snooze by your side or in the sunlight.

He sheds, so his fosters loves sitting on the ground and brushing him, which he also loves. He only meows when it’s around meal time and has no problem using the litter box. A wand toy and a soft blanket are two necessities to have. He’ll get active after breakfast, after dinner, and again around 10, so that’s when his foster knows to get out the toy. He’s not a picky eater and loves his Temptations treats. His strength is using his senses to find something, so he likes when his foster throws the treat down the hallway so he can practice finding it. Recently, he’s enjoyed sitting on the windowsill and watching the birds and outside action on the street below. He’s been open and loving to other people who visit his temporary home. He’s so loyal and will typically follow his fosters around the apartment as they go about their day. All in all, Sporadic makes his people laugh all the time.

He loves wand toys, little mice toys he can bat around, and especially the cat laser, which he and T-Bone will chase around for as long as possible! Ribeye is so full of personality and is an affectionate little guy! He loooves attention so don’t be surprised if he seemingly randomly runs up to you, meowing and trilling, looking for pets! Once you start petting him, he’ll start purring instantly and will eventually lie down in your lap, purring until he falls asleep.

19278184,description,"Tully is a sweet boy who loves to rub on your legs, follow you around and have a chat! He loves to curl up next to and/or on top of his favorite humans for a cuddle. Tully is happiest when he's around people, whether they're working, eating, or just lounging around with friends. He loves morning brushes and playing with string toys, and he's even learned how to sit on command for snacks and right before meal time. When he's feeling a bit overstimulated, he'll let you know and just needs a few minutes to himself before always coming back for more love and attention. Tully would prefer a home without very young children or other animals. Tully is FIV+ and will live a normal healthy and long life when provided with quality care such as a balanced diet and yearly wellness exams (like any cat). As FIV+ is not transmittable between neutered/spayed cats under normal circumstances, we are happy for FIV+ cats to mingle with FIV- cats in their adoptive homes.",2023-07-08 17:09:22+00:00,

19426373,description,"These siblings are a hilarious duo. Both are gorgeous, sleek black cats, Sapling with fiery red undertones in her fur that glow in the sunlight and TW with adorable white markings on his belly that resemble a bikini (perfect for him because he loves to sunbathe). Sapling likes to be in the same room as other people, or birdwatching out a window. She’ll let you pet her, but in true cat fashion it has to be on her terms. She is a fanatic for feathers and toys with bells on them and will gladly play all day. TW is a big shy sweetheart. It takes him a while to come out of his shell and he likes a cozy place to retreat to when new people are around. When he gets to know you, he curls right up next to you ready for pets and belly rubs. They’re both great eaters with a taste for fishy treats! They love an opportunity to play around with either ribbons or proper cat toys. They love playing and wrestling with each other and get along very well with other cats. That said, they’re also happy being the only two cats around. They’d make an adorably great addition to your house/apartment.",2023-07-08 17:09:22+00:00,

19186640,description,"Valentine is a handsome, slightly scruffy, earnest boy who has seen some hard times. He’s a little broken and his confidence has worn off, but he is so grateful and excited about any positive attention — headbutting and rolling around. He's so happy to see you for a cuddle and some scritches, but as soon as you move away, he is pretty sure that nothing good is going to happen and will cower away and try and hide. It’s so sad to see such a lovely sweet kitty be so scared — he clearly had some pretty bad experiences before he came to us. If you are interested in giving this lonely boy some time and attention and help him get over his fears he would be the best companion.",2023-07-08 17:09:22+00:00,

She is quiet and calm and spends most of her time lounging where she can have a good view of the room. She likes to have her head and back brushed, and to play with toys. When she gets the zoomies, she sometimes puffs her tail out all the way and romps around. Vixen will meow unhappily or hiss if you try to pick her up or touch forbidden areas like the legs and belly. That said, with a bribe of Meow Mix Irresistibles cat treats she has become much more accepting of petting and she may continue to adjust. Vixen does not like other cats.

And their perfect little faces are matched only by their amazing personalities. Wavelength is an intrepid explorer, climbing over every surface until he eventually finds your lap and snuggles down for a nap. His huge white ears and big green eyes are too cute for words. Wallflower is his slightly more relaxed partner in crime – she likes to observe his antics, occasionally give chase, and then settle in by your feet. She’s a tuxedo beauty with a perpetually surprised expression, highlighted by perfect white whiskers. These sweet siblings are affectionate, playful, and goofy, and they’re sure to get along with anyone. These two cats are bonded and must be adopted together, applications for just one of them will not be processed. Please note that they may not yet be spayed/neutered -- their adoption fee may be higher to cover their surgeries.",2023-07-08 17:09:22+00:00,

This handsome tabby boy is looking for a forever home where he can lounge with his human and shower them with love and affection. He loves to be pet and will flop over to show his belly for a rub. He purrs (every day a little louder than before), kneads like the expert biscuit maker that he is and thoroughly enjoys a paw massage. This sociable boy loves to meet new people and be in the center of the action. He’s not a picky eater and excitedly chirps at meal times to let you know he is in his happy place.

18956052,description,"Cassava and Baby Corn are a delight to have around — they are playful, curious and cuddly. Baby Corn is the adventurer. He loves teasing other animals (cats or dogs), even when they are not too fond of him. It doesn't take much to get him purring — just a simple touch or sitting next to him will get his motor roaring. He adores belly rubs and will throw himself on the floor and give you his belly. Cassava is a bit shyer, but loves attention on his own terms. He enjoys cuddling during bedtime and sleeping close to his person and getting gentle pet. He is a loyal friend who will defend his person and home from dangerous vegetables — beware onions and potatoes! These bonded bffs are good with cats, dogs and children.",,2023-07-08 17:09:22+00:00

17575802,description,"Castle is the sweetest friend to have around the house. She might be a little slow to warm up to you at first, but once you have won her loyalty, this tabby won’t be afraid to follow you around, nudge, and nuzzle you. She will greet you at the door when you come home each day and will meow when she’s hungry or when she wants you to wake up and give her attention. She goes absolutely crazy for chicken treats and will climb onto your lap for one. Castle is independent, explorative, and confident, and a sweet household companion who takes great interest in all that her humans do. She does have some kidney issues, which are currently stable but requires a special food – which, luckily, she loves. Castle would make a great pet for any family. She is very low maintenance and mostly likes to lay in a soft bed and explore when it’s quiet, but she’s even happier when rubbing against her humans and being pet. Castle is in need of an echocardiogram and dental surgery, but we'd be happy to partner with her adopters to ensure that this lady gets the treatment that she needs to be happy and healthy.",,2023-07-08 17:09:22+00:00

18666870,description,"Corso will be a sweet little addition to a patient household. Rescued from a Staten Island hoarding situation, he’s shy and wary at first but has warmed up immensely to become a funny little lovebug! He spends a lot of the day napping and lazing but will come out to socialize whenever you call for him, and likes to be underfoot wherever you are just so you know he’s there. Lately he’s been a fan of perching on top of the kitchen cabinets so he gets a good view of all the action. Corso loves bare feet and will rub his face on your toes! Scritches are very much welcomed as well, especially on the head and under the chin. Corso is a happy eater and litter box pro. While he’s not quite ready to crawl into your lap on his own, he’s open to being picked up and cuddled so maybe he’s close! He’s curious about windows and will try to climb them to check out the views. Corso likes playing with his catnip mice and sushi toys around the house, and loves batting at his wand toy, especially in the evening.",,2023-07-08 17:09:22+00:00

They’re extremely affectionate and will start purring as soon as they catch sight of you and they are obsessed with cuddling. Crest (grey with white belly and feet) is very curious and the adventurer of the bunch. She is the most cuddly and loves to steal all of the attention to get all of the pets. Colgate (brown tabby) is spunky and makes the cutest little expressions. Colgate loves playing with his sisters and could chase a toy on a string for hours. Oral B (grey with spots) has giant yellow/green eyes that will melt your heart. These kittens would love to be adopted as a trio. They have a sibling that tested positive for FeLV so can’t be adopted into a home with other cats until they can get retested when they are older.

18576182,description,"Don’t be fooled by the semi-grumpy face – it is hard to take a good picture of Daniel Tiger because he prefers to snuggle as close as he possibly can! Daniel Tiger is a beautiful, chunky, pet-loving cat with a very loud, deep purr.  He recently became an indoor cat and is adjusting so well – his litter box habits are impeccable, he loves pets, and he is very sweet.  His hobbies include snuggling with stuffed animals, getting many pets and chin-scratches, and snoozing.  He has learned that he loves toys and especially loves the cat dancer.  We would guess that he would be a solid mouser, should that skill be necessary.  Daniel recently sat on his first lap, and likes to sit very close to whoever is petting him. He seems to like other cats and would be happy with a friend (although the resident cats in his foster home do not return the sentiment). He is a very special guy! Daniel is in need of dental surgery and we are hoping his adopters can help cover the cost – we’re happy to talk more about this!",,2023-07-08 17:09:22+00:00

They cuddle together like yin and yang. They are also very much enjoy human company and warm people laps. Even though they are 13 years old, they still love to play with feathers, lasers and balls. Lulu was born to be a lap kitty. Whomever is lucky enough to have Lulu in their lap, will be rewarded with a look of complete adoration and a warm purr. Lulu loves affection, she loves company and she loves chilling out with her sister Dolly. She is a true lover. Dolly has an intrepid, brave spirit while still being very affectionate. She very rarely cries and asks for very little (other than some delicious wet food). She is very intuitive and often knows when you are feeling stressed or down in which case she will come hop on your lap.She still loves to play feather games and has caught more laser beams than any other cat on the block. Their current owner rescued them outdoors as kittens but a parent who is allergic to cats is moving in with the family and she can no longer keep them. Lulu is missing her right front paw, but it has caused her no trouble at all. Dolly and Lulu are spayed and up to date on vaccines. Both cats will need some extra medical care. Lulu needs dental work. Dolly could likely use dental work as well and might do well to take a joint supplement. Interested adopters can discuss with their current owner any costs for their care. *Courtesy Posting: This cat is being independently offered for adoption by a rescuer who is not a representative of BBAWC or Brooklyn Cat Cafe.

18950799,description,"Earthquake and Wildfire are inseparable balls of energy and joy. Wildfire (brown tabby with spots on his belly) is a champion snuggler. He jumps up on the couch and folds himself in as close as possible to the nearest human. Earthquake (white with fascinating black splotches and soulful eyes) has been slower to appreciate the delight of snuggles but we’re sure that with a little more time and patience, she’ll continue to come out of her shell and be the most lovely and loving kitten around. In the meantime, Wildfire plays the protective brother by looking out for her and making sure she’s still involved in whatever games, explorations, and mischief that he gets up to. Both kittens have beautiful voices and call to each other in little chirps and cat songs when they’re playing or can’t find each other. They both enjoy Churu, zooming around the house at top speed, and playing with their favorite toy - a cat wand with ribbons, feathers, and a bell tied to a spring.",,2023-07-08 17:09:22+00:00

18234354,description,"Emmy is a wide-eyed little lady with a half mustache who exudes non-stop friendliness and an earnest desire to be pet, even when her flight instinct slightly delays the process. Although initially a bit shy when she meets someone new, she will just dash away into a safer spot and then wait to be followed for scritches. The person who takes the time to build trust with Emmy will have earned a silly sweetheart of a best friend. Emmy is energetic and playful and loves swatting toys around and finding fun games with curtains and rugs. She is patient when becoming friends with other cats, but is overjoyed when they are ready for a wrestling match or a good chase. She is currently living with a dog and doesn’t seem to mind. Emmy was rescued during the rain from outside of a playground in Fort Greene. The next day, tiny kittens were found on the opposite side of the playground, and we realized that they were her’s and Emmy was so relieved to be united with her babies. Now that they are older, she is enjoying the opportunity to be a kitten herself. Emmy would be happiest in a home with at least one other young and playful feline friend and would probably do well with polite young humans as well. It has been such a joy watching this sweetheart blossom now that she’s safe and healthy and her forever family will be lucky to help her continue her journey.",,2023-07-08 17:09:22+00:00

17850952,description,"Zapps and Funyun are a playful and ridiculous pair of siblings. Although they were pretty resistant to humans when they came to their foster home (and will need time and patience when first adjusting to their forever home), they have made tremendous strides and are now BIG fans of the indoor life. They are rambunctious, mischievous, and keep each other entertained. When they were rescued they were scared to be touched by humans, but they are growing to love cuddles and pets. Foster mom has no doubt they will flourish and become happy housecats in a kind and patient home. Funyun is a natural sweetie and will warm up first. She’s obsessed with treats and loves the smell of chicken. She enjoys a wand toy as well as her special stuffed penguin toy and will play catch with herself – she’ll throw the toy in the air and then run after it!. She has a very playful and curious personality. At mealtime, she’ll come up to you for pets with a big purr and lots of leg rubs. Zapps is more timid, but she has a big personality once she’s comfortable. She loves making biscuits on a cozy poof/pillow and running from end to end of the apartment. She’s learning to enjoy pets and has the sweetest mews. She also loves to sit in the window and eventually at the end of your bed to warm your feet! She’s obsessed with any flavor Churru, laser toys, and felt mice. These ladies are so cute, but likely wouldn’t be best in a home with small children as they can be a bit feisty during playtime and will need some time to get accustomed to their new home.",,2023-07-08 17:09:22+00:00

18384141,description,"Gracie and Olive are a healthy bonded pair of orange ladies waiting to brighten up your day! Gracie (orange & white) is the life of the party, and a big fan of headbutts and cuddles. Gracie will sit on your lap and purr for hours if you let her. This loud purring machine likes to follow her human around and is basically a dog in a cat suit. Gracie loves to be pet all over her body and is always ready for cuddle time. Olive (orange) is a tiny little bit reserved, but curious and sweet. If you want a rewarding relationship, let her get to know you and watch her come out of her shell. It won’t take long because Olive can easily be convinced by toys and treats ;) Olive likes when her cheeks and chin are scritched and will gently rub against you to ask for more. Gracie and Olive both love playing with toys and exploring. If they are not actively pouncing on toys, you will find them sitting in front of the TV, watching birds and sometimes squirrels. They’re mild mannered and are good at interacting with anyone as long as they’re respectful of the cat's boundaries.

18439002,description,"Wild East (black and white) is a curious playful kitten who takes her naptime as seriously as playtime. She’s being fostered with two senior dogs and her brother, Grimm, who she plays with constantly (the dogs she admires from afar). Wild East’s favorite snack is chicken pate from a tube and her favorite activity is batting at plastic balls that roll in a circle. She enjoys long naps in the sun and watching faucet water. Grimm (all black) is the most classic, textbook kitten there ever was. He enjoys sprinting from one part of the apartment down to the other, playing with whatever toy is closest, and chin scritches. He’s super friendly to his shihtzu foster brother and can frequently be found playing and/or napping with his sister, Wild East. His favorite treat is anything he successfully steals from his sister and his favorite activities include typing on the keyboard during work hours, starring in Zoom calls, and purring very loudly.",,2023-07-08 17:09:22+00:00

Sasha is the tuxedo. She is a petite girl who gives the impression she is in a grumpy mood from her downturned mouth. But Sasha is anything but grumpy. She is a sweet girl who is ALWAYS purring. She loves to snuggle up against you to let you know she is ready to be loved and petted. She never gets enough of that. Sasha is very affectionate. She will alert you when it’s time for breakfast and dinner with the cutest little chirps. She loves to eat! And she LOVES treats… Churu being her absolute hands down favorite. She is always up for playtime with a wand toy. Hershey is the silver tabby. She is a little shy at first meet and greet. She is a low maintenance, mellow cat. She enjoys being pet and will raise her backside to be sure she is getting the full effect of your affection. She has begun to cuddle by her foster’s leg and will lay her head down on her leg for a little nap. She has come a long way since she was rescued from a life on the streets being bullied. Hershey will absolutely stand at attention for Churu treats!! Her absolute favorite! So if you’re looking for a pair of BFFs to hang out with on the couch and watch Netflix … Hershey and Sasha are your girls. Hershey and Sasha are spayed, up to date on vaccinations, microchipped and healthy. *Courtesy Posting: This cat is being independently offered for adoption by a rescuer who is not a representative of BBAWC or Brooklyn Cat Cafe.

18222932,description,"Always wanted a snuggle buddy who won’t give you a choice in the matter? Of course! Howard is a caring, purring, meowing, licking goober - and he's looking for his forever home. Cautious at first in his new foster home, Howard’s End was slow to explore the entirety of his new home, but quick to open up and snuggle. A little patience will allow him to open up and show you his true chill, loving self who adores cuddling close to you in bed and purring away to show his state of supreme relaxation and enjoyment. Give him a chin scratch and he’s in a state of bliss! Once he’s settled in, he will show you just how friendly he is. He will come to the door to say hello when you arrive home and is very comfortable with strangers. Ever hungry it would seem, Howard is constantly on the lookout for the next meal and will ru and devour any plate of cat food you put in front of him, licking the bowl clean to get any remaining scraps. As if Howard couldn’t get any better, he has also proven to be very open to feline friends. The moment his new housemate Sebastian showed up, Howard couldn’t wait to meet and play. Once both cats are settled, it’s non-stop zoomie and play wrestling time for the two friends. Whether you’re looking to become a one-cat household or you have an FeLV cat who would like a companion, Howard’s the cat to have! Because Howard has FeLV, he can only be around other FeLV cats, but he is visibly healthy with no outward signs of FeLV. He will have the best chance at living many more years in a caring home with a proper diet.",,2023-07-08 17:09:22+00:00

Jibb is the first to explore, eat and play. She will bite the churu right out the tube which is really cute. She really loves scratches around the face and will give you some welcoming purrs while on her back with all four legs up – and she’ll let you know when it’s time for more scratches. She loves to take care of Luff by cleaning his face. Though twice the size of his cousin, Luff (orange) is much more shy and reserved than Jib. He usually lets her lead the way first in playing and exploring, but once he’ll join in on the fun once he feels comfortable. He likes laying in the cat bed on the adult bed where he is snuggled up and over time he will make his way closer & closer to you up to laying up against you for a bit before returning back to his favorite spot. He becomes a lot more welcoming & even looking for scratches when he’s a bit tired and getting ready for sleep. He’s a little more chill than and less mischievous than his buddy. They compliment each other well. Both kittens love playing with each other and lots of treats! They are very energetic and you must be ready to play. They’re also great napping buddies.",,2023-07-08 17:09:22+00:00

18724375,description,"Legion is a super sweet boy who will do anything for a chin rub or belly rub. He will come to you if you hold out your hand and immediately go ham on your hands. He’ll purr like a maniac and then wrap himself around your legs because he’s that desperate for your love – and you should give it to him! When he’s not eating or sleeping, he likes to loaf in a little comfy area and just relax. He doesn’t like loud sounds or the vacuum (his mortal enemy!). He loves his peace and quiet, and enjoys rubs and petting in relative silence. What a sweet boy!",,2023-07-08 17:09:22+00:00

18724803,description,"Melody and Grey Champion are a strikingly mismatched duo that bring out the best in each other. Both girls like to trill and chat to each other from room to room – it’s so cute! They’re both playful, are chatty to humans and cats alike, and are total mushes for treats and chin rubs. Grey Champion (dilute calico) is quirky and a total ham. She loves to supervise household activities and will follow you from room to room. She’ll also keep you on a tight schedule – no need for a clock when Grey Champion is around! She always knows when it’s mealtime. She’ll dramatically flop down on her back and wiggle, jump up to rub up on your legs, and sing you a little chirpy tune while you prepare her favorite wet food. Melody is loving, brave, and always the first in line for treats, pets, and playtime. Don’t be fooled by her constantly shocked expression with her striking gold eyes, this girl is a lap cat and very chill. She’s a total love bug with a loud purr (she sounds like a tiny tractor) and is always looking for warm laps and more pets. She loves to run over and arch her back in the cutest way to ask for just a few more scritches. Both girls share a great passion for chicken pate, cuddling in one bed, and chasing plastic springs. They can’t wait to find their perfect home with you!",,2023-07-08 17:09:22+00:00

Jules (tabby) is sweet and loves cuddles, and once he decides to trust you, he will curl up in your lap and purr loudly to express his love. Both kittens enjoy playing soccer with their catnip toys, chasing their wand toy, and zooming through the apartment with the cutest pitter-patters all night. They are still pretty shy, so it will take them a bit to warm up to you, but once they do, their sweet and silly personalities will shine.",,2023-07-08 17:09:22+00:00

He’s a big fan of wrestling (see video for an example) and chasing the laser pointer, as well as taking long naps wherever seems the comfiest. Muncho can be very scared, but if you take small steps he will start to warm up. He’s still a work in progress, so he would do best with a patient adopter who can show him that people aren’t scary.

He's very playful and will keep himself entertained with toys until Bowery joins in.",,2023-07-08 17:09:22+00:00

18950812,description,"Pajamas is a sweet and shy girl who is slowly coming out of her shell. This dainty girl loves to play and makes a good office buddy while working. She does need her personal space, but is gradually showing more and more curiosity about engaging with her foster human. She is a great eater and treats are a fabulous way to her heart. Pajamas especially enjoys cozy nooks, Churus, and getting toys stuck under furniture so they’re more of a challenge. She would likely be perfectly happy as your one and only cat, but she also does not appear to be bothered by other cats and interacting with her foster sister is helping her to open up. It is a joy to see her grow increasingly more comfortable being inside with people.",,2023-07-08 17:09:22+00:00

17952492,description,"Sometimes the best things are worth the wait – and sweet Papa Watkins is a great example. Sick and scared when he first went to foster, this guy slowly and surely became healthier and started to blossom into a more confident companion. He now LOVES head pets and scritches and seeks out attention from his foster parents, no longer running and hiding when he’s scared.. Papa Watkins is a champion napper and eater and will never say no to a pet or treat. He loves to chase balls around the apartment and he’s developed an adorable tendency to drool when he’s super content. His newest way of asking for attention is to lay down at your feet, placing a paw or his head directly on your foot just to say he’s there. This sweetheart needs a home where his new family can spoil him with love and attention. Papa Watkins had been living in a slightly managed outdoor colony for a couple of years, but was always too busy fighting or hanging with the lady cats to go into a trap, until one bitter cold night when he was scavenging through recycling and hungry enough to get rescued. Papa Watkins is FIV+ and will live a normal, healthy life when provided with quality care such as a balanced diet and yearly wellness exams (like any cat). As FIV+ is not transmittable between neutered/spayed cats under normal circumstances, we are happy for FIV+ cats to mingle with FIV- cats in their adoptive homes.",,2023-07-08 17:09:22+00:00

Are you watching TV? They will happily join you on the couch for snuggles. Rock is curious and courageous once he has adapted to his new environment and will snuggle with you for ages. If you start scratching him behind his ear he will actively push against your hand to show you he wants more. It takes a little longer to win Paper’s trust, but with some bribery (treats) Paper will also be a great snuggle buddy.

18468089,description,"Add some spice to your household with Sebastian! He’s talkative, playful and loves head scratches. While he was initially cautious on arrival in his new foster home, after a few days Sebastian was exploring his new home with great curiosity. Once he has settled in, he is a confident, independent cat, who will rush to the front door to greet you the second you arrive home. He is also comfortable around visitors to the home and asks for pets and head scratches from his foster and strangers alike. Sebastian is good pals with his foster housemate Howard’s End and is eager to engage in playful zoomies and play wrestling with his fellow orange tabby buddy. Whether you’re looking to become a one-cat household or you have an FeLV cat who would like a companion, Sebastian is a cat who can do both if you have a little patience. One thing that might surprise you about Sebastian is his enormous appetite. He behaves around food as if he hasn’t eaten for a month (and won’t eat again for another month) and will try to sniff out and scavenge any food he can find. A counter surfer at heart, he will even eat vegetables you might usually expect cats to turn their noses up at. Peas? Yup! Green beans? Yes please! Once a street cat, always a street cat! Because Sebastian has FeLV, he can only be around other FeLV cats, but he is visibly healthy with no outward signs of FeLV. He will have the best chance at living many more years in a caring home with a proper diet.",,2023-07-08 17:09:22+00:00

18949220,description,"Shallot, Arrowhead, and Water Chestnut are total and complete goofs. They are little bundles of energy that love to run around and play with each other until they are exhausted, and then they take a long nap piled on top of each other in their cat bed. Shallot is a tabby girl with a white stripe on her face and is definitely the leader of the pack. She loves stuffed mice toys and especially loves the laser pointer. Now and then she gets in a cuddly mood and wants nothing more than to snuggle up to your face. Arrowhead is a tabby wit a white “mountain” pattern on his face. He sometimes still gets jumpy and runs away when he sees his fosters coming, but when he’s feeling brave and they pet him, he starts purring right away. He loves to play with his sisters, and he even likes to cuddle with his humans at night. Water Chestnut is the gray girl. She tends to be a bit calmer than her brother and sister, but when she’s in the mood she’ll play and run around with them too. She’s an expert at finding the coziest looking spots to sleep. If you pick her up she’ll let you hold her for as long as you’ll rub her tummy. These three kittens are sweet, silly, and playful. They’d be great in any home that’s ready to embrace their energy and give them lots of love and attention. They can be adopted as a trio, two of them as a pair, or one of them with another kitten their age. All three are equally friends and will be happy as long as they have a playmate.",,2023-07-08 17:09:22+00:00

18663589,description,"Shiitake and Reishi are loving, look-alike brothers with distinct personalities that make the perfect pair. Shiitake is eager one for pets and food, wrapping himself around your legs to always ask for more. Reishi is more laid back , calm and sweet, quietly loving pets. Shiitake is very curious and adventurous while Reishi is more independent and easily entertains himself with a good box — on top or inside, big or small, he will find a way to make good use of any leftover box. There are a few things these boys have in common including a devotion to treats, a love for playing together and a deep appreciation for cuddling on a sunny spot on the couch. These smart brothers are learning how to do tricks! Although still in the early stages of their training, they have already mastered how to sit. Bring these boys home and teach them their next trick!",,2023-07-08 17:09:22+00:00

18931580,description,"Say hello to The Real Don Steal — a mellow adult gentleman of tremendous floof. He enjoys lounging around and looking out the window or snuggling up in a suitcase under the bed.  If given the opportunity to snuggle with humans, he will most likely jump right in, although he's still fairly shy and tentative so it does take some patience to get him out of his shell. He has zero interest in snuggling (or doing anything else for that matter) with other cats, and must be the only cat in the home. A crucial aspect of Don Steele is that he is the sworn enemy of all TVs or large screens of that nature. The minute the TV goes on, he looks up terrified at the TV like ""YOU AGAIN! How did you find me here?! You'll never get me!!!"" and then either he ducks under the bed or runs from the room in total terror. (He is specifically ultra-disturbed by the Roku jungle screensaver.) He's been working on building up screen tolerance in foster, but has only made it up to tolerance of a 13"" computer screen. Thus, he's probably best suited to someone who does not watch a ton of TV/doesn't have one of those magic mirror gyms where the mirror comes to life as a person.",,2023-07-08 17:09:22+00:00

18469036,description,"TW and Sapling will certainly add some cuteness and excitement to your life. They love playing and wrestling with each other and get along extremely well with other cats in the household. Sapling likes to be close to people (she’s almost always in the same room as her foster), but isn’t much of a cuddler. TW is more independent, but will curl right up next to you on the couch. 

Both cats are gorgeous, sleek black cats. Sapling has red undertones to his slightly fluffier coat and TW has adorable white markings on her belly (they’ve been described as a little bikini). 

These kittens love an opportunity to play around with either ribbons or “real” cat toys.",,2023-07-08 17:09:22+00:00

18667410,description,"Cat? Rabbit? Muppet? Waldorf is a senior cat with many distinct and loveable qualities. He loves to be around people and will never shy away from asking for scritches, pets, brushies and more food. And boy oh boy does he love food! He knows what he wants and will gladly steal that yummy looking steak off your plate. And like a true gentleman, he prefers water out of a cup, but if he must, a bowl will do just fine. His delicate tummy loves novel protein food because he’s all about that non-GMO lifestyle. Waldorf is on a once daily pill for a chronic health issue but he takes his pill like a champ. Won’t you adopt this sweet senior boy home and help make the last chapters of his life the best ever?",,2023-07-08 17:09:22+00:00

18895748,description,"Winston is the charmer of the duo. She’s more chill with people and okay with being pet and picked up. She’s learning to purr and doing it well. Venkman is much like his namesake from Ghostbusters — more reserved, shy, and vocal of the two. He chirps a lot- especially when he’s away from his sister. He’s a bit of a ‘tough guy’ who’s trying to hide his sensitive side. They are quite the combo. They love to play. And eat. And knock each other off the tub.",,2023-07-08 17:09:22+00:00

18587232,description,"Wonky may be the cuddliest kitten in the world. He must jump in your lap or be held whenever you get home from work/an outside activity. When Wonky is held, he immediately starts to suck his thumb and purr loudly. Just like a baby, sucking his thumb puts him right to sleep. He prefers to sleep on his human’s lap, chest, or neck. Whenever Wonky is not cuddling, he is eating or zooming through the apartment. Wonky is very social and loves to eat dry food when his humans are eating meals. His meals give him super cat speed, and he zooms through the apartment like a torpedo. Wonky enjoys chasing string toys and showing off his hunting/stalking instincts. Wonky will let you know when he needs attention with the sweetest “mew” and enjoys following his human wherever they may go. You cannot help but be smitten with this kitten’s loving and social personality. Wheezy is a curious and fearless little kitten. She loves toys (especially chewing on her plush avocado) and is very serious about chasing her mouse or jingling balls. Wheezy will run full speed ahead despite her light “wheezy” breath. She has been given a round of antibiotics which has significantly helped her sneezing and wheezing. Wheezy is the first to explore new rooms and spaces and does occasionally attempt to bolt out the front door (so always be aware). When Wheezy is sleepy, she is quick to fold into your arms and loudly purr. Wheezy also loves to nibble on her brother’s ear when she is feeling especially cuddly and comfortable. She enjoys litterboxes that are neat and tidy with taller sides for privacy. In the past, Wheezy has relieved herself in the bathtub. However, when that is not an option (bathroom door closed), she eventually finds her way to the litterbox. Wheezy may be a tiny kitten, but she is mighty and makes her presence known. You cannot help but be enamored by Wheezy’s adorable face and feisty spirit.",,2023-07-08 17:09:22+00:00
