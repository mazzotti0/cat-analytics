You’ll find her cleaning up her siblings BFF Cuttlefish, making sure everyone is in tip-top shape to take charge of the day ahead. Cuttlefish has the most heart-warming, endearing round eyes. He’s still a bit unsure of us humans but is warming up a little bit more each day. You’ll find him first in line for breakfast and Churu. This cutie is now comfortable coming up into your lap so long as Churu is on the menu. This is when you can sneak a few quick pets in – soon enough he’ll be onboard for endless cuddles. He’s the athlete of the family and loves to play with a string toy or kick a ball around (do we have our next international futbol star?!).",2023-01-22 19:13:48+00:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,True,True,True,False,True,True,True,True,True,True,True,True,True,row_deleted

They were trapped in a yard with 20 other cats and the owner asked that all of them be euthanized. Of course, that wasn’t happening and we were happy to snap them up and introduce them to the good, warm, treat-filled, life. These four kittens may have begun as tiny hissy monsters, but now they are playful and snuggly (especially if you happen to have a can of food handy or, even more especially, churu treats). Young Goodman Brown was the first to realize humans were really just giant vehicles for treat dispensing and pets. He’s also a champ with the wand toy and a scourge to toy mice everywhere. Feathertop is the brave explorer of the bunch, always keen to find the highest perch or sneak out of his foster room to chirrup agreeably at the horrified resident cats. Blithedale Romance is a very charming calico who took a bit to come around but is now a happy snuggler. The Great Carbuncle is a relatively rare orange lady cat. Terrible eye infections before she was rescued have made her eyes slightly cloudy but she sees well and is just as likely to pounce on a flying toy as her siblings. She will be the wariest initially but also the first to purr when you corner her for a snuggle!

She purrs so loud that you can hear her from across the room. Although she can be a real hide-and-seek player in the beginning, after she gets to know you, she will be with you everywhere around the house. Saint Cyr is more playful. He likes to explore and play with everything he can find (even a tissue). He is a real foodie and loves treats, but sometimes he will be more interested in human food than his own.
