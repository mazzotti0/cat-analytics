TW is more independent, but will curl right up next to you on the couch.\\xa0\\n\\nBoth cats are gorgeous, sleek black cats. Sapling has red undertones to his slightly fluffier coat and TW has adorable white markings on her belly (they’ve been described as a little bikini).\\xa0\\n\\nThese kittens love an opportunity to play around with either ribbons or “real” cat toys.'"
