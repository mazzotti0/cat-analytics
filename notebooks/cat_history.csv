He warms up to you almost immediately and will sit by you for pets and snuggles. He loves to be near you and will follow you wherever you go. Both cats really enjoy being around each other, and they bring out the best in one another. Negroni is less shy when Gino is around, and Gino is more relaxed when Negroni is nearby. They are both just so sweet! Editor's note: This is an epic cat love story. Trapped near each other, their rescuer assumed they were friends but not particularly attached to each other, just fans of other cats. When they were sent to separate foster homes Gino cried all night and Negroni retreated under a sink and hissed and swiped. As soon as they were reunited all of that fell away. They had just been pining!",2023-03-13 13:36:56+00:00

Named after a giraffe due to his colors and length, this guy is just ready for affection and attention. He has a way of hugging you while you hold him and nestling into your neck. Melman is friendly, outgoing, affectionate, cuddly — and occasional suffers from outbreaks of single kitten/fratboy jerk syndrome. He loves to to explore and climb furniture and make sure nothing is precariously placed (such a helpful guy!). He follows his foster around the apartment when not receiving enough attention. He enjoys other cats, but has emphatically declined to share their home with any dogs. Although we don’t know his history, we suspect that Melman was raised as a single kitten and taught to play rough — which is why he is just now learning appropriate play behavior. While he does need his 20 hours of beauty sleep, he is otherwise pretty active and needs space and an appropriate cat companion for a good chase or wrestling match. Melman is generally kind and cuddly with humans (he is a total snuggle bug), but can get nippy without enough stimulation. When he decide it’s time to wrestle and play rough, he will happily choose you if not redirected to the appropriate playmate / cat toy with potentially painful consequences. Melman needs to go to an experienced home with someone who is able to understand and pay attention to cat body language and willing to create structure and boundaries AND with an active and assertive adult cat with similar play instincts and energy. No kids.",2023-03-13 13:36:56+00:00

How did you find me here?! You'll never get me!!!"" and then either he ducks under the bed or runs from the room in total terror. (He is specifically ultra-disturbed by the Roku jungle screensaver.) He's been working on building up screen tolerance in foster, but has only made it up to tolerance of a 13"" computer screen.

Turbo is definitely the brains of the operation and will often send his buddy out to investigate new situations. Winding Road is obsessed with playing and really, really bad at hide and seek. These besties are good with other cats and would be happy with kids or dogs.",2023-03-13 13:36:56+00:00
18895748,https://catcafebk.com/our-cats/?cat=18895748,Winston & Venkman,6 Months 12 Days ,,False,True,True,False,True,False,Domestic Short Hair ,"Winston is the charmer of the duo. She’s more chill with people and okay with being pet and picked up. She’s learning to purr and doing it well. Venkman is much like his namesake from Ghostbusters — more reserved, shy, and vocal of the two. He chirps a lot- especially when he’s away from his sister. He’s a bit of a ‘tough guy’ who’s trying to hide his sensitive side. They are quite the combo. They love to play. And eat. And knock each other off the tub.",2023-03-13 13:36:56+00:00
18587232,https://catcafebk.com/our-cats/?cat=18587232,Wonky & Wheezy,11 Months 2 Days ,,False,True,True,False,True,False,Domestic Short Hair ,"Wonky may be the cuddliest kitten in the world. He must jump in your lap or be held whenever you get home from work/an outside activity. When Wonky is held, he immediately starts to suck his thumb and purr loudly. Just like a baby, sucking his thumb puts him right to sleep. He prefers to sleep on his human’s lap, chest, or neck. Whenever Wonky is not cuddling, he is eating or zooming through the apartment. Wonky is very social and loves to eat dry food when his humans are eating meals. His meals give him super cat speed, and he zooms through the apartment like a torpedo. Wonky enjoys chasing string toys and showing off his hunting/stalking instincts. Wonky will let you know when he needs attention with the sweetest “mew” and enjoys following his human wherever they may go. You cannot help but be smitten with this kitten’s loving and social personality. Wheezy is a curious and fearless little kitten. She loves toys (especially chewing on her plush avocado) and is very serious about chasing her mouse or jingling balls. Wheezy will run full speed ahead despite her light “wheezy” breath. She has been given a round of antibiotics which has significantly helped her sneezing and wheezing. Wheezy is the first to explore new rooms and spaces and does occasionally attempt to bolt out the front door (so always be aware). When Wheezy is sleepy, she is quick to fold into your arms and loudly purr. Wheezy also loves to nibble on her brother’s ear when she is feeling especially cuddly and comfortable. She enjoys litterboxes that are neat and tidy with taller sides for privacy. In the past, Wheezy has relieved herself in the bathtub. However, when that is not an option (bathroom door closed), she eventually finds her way to the litterbox. Wheezy may be a tiny kitten, but she is mighty and makes her presence known. You cannot help but be enamored by Wheezy’s adorable face and feisty spirit.",2023-03-13 13:36:56+00:00
19073101,https://catcafebk.com/our-cats/?cat=19073101,Yarrow,6 Years 3 Months , Female,False,True,True,True,False,True,Domestic Short Hair ,"Yarrow is a sweet, cuddly lady who loves to snuggle! She spends most of her day napping on every available soft/warm surface: on the couch, armchair, the sweatshirt that was accidentally left on the floor for an hour. Despite only having one eye, she maneuvers expertly through the apartment. Yarrow doesn’t have a traditional ‘meow’ (she will open her mouth to meow but only a barely discernible squeak will come out) - though she has something that sounds like chronic congestion / asthma that makes her sound like a mini one-eyed Darth Vader. Occasionally, when she’s really trying to get your attention, she’ll howl (sounds like someone complaining “Ow…. Ow….”). But no meowing. Just sniffling and occasional howling, no in between! She is such a gem.",2023-03-13 13:36:56+00:00
18989033,https://catcafebk.com/our-cats/?cat=18989033,Yoda,7 Years 3 Months , Male,False,True,False,True,False,True,Domestic Short Hair ,"Yoda is the most snuggly lap cat one could ask for. This friendly boy is a gentle giant who will crawl onto your lap or chest and make himself at home. He loves chin scritches, belly rubs, and being held like a baby, spooned, cradled, petted…you name it. He also loves to lick humans, and will lick your hand / arm / face if you let him. Since he is so social, he will be happiest in a home with people who are able to give him the attention he seeks and who either work from home or have a flexible schedule and won’t leave him alone for extended periods of time over multiple days. Yoda is a lowkey cat, who spends most of the day napping in a quiet spot. He lives up to his name, and really does look like a version of baby Yoda with his wide-set ears and sleepy eyes. He’s not a picky eater and gets chatty when he’s hungry and will tell you he wants food with his sweet meow! He likes to play with wand toys. At night he sleeps on the foot of the bed or will climb up and curl up into a body nook. He is not a fan of closed doors. Yoda does have some health issues that we are getting under control and we'd be happy to talk more about what this sweet guy needs to get healthy.",2023-03-13 13:36:56+00:00
